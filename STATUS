Release:

    2.0: In pre-alpha development

Plan:

    * Vague goal of an alpha or beta release in 1999. Commit-then-review
      is active.

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * CGI doesn't work
        Status: Ben Laurie is working on this.

    * mod_status doesn't work
        Status: Manoj Kasichainula <manojk@io.com> is working on this. A
        patch has been posted that starts to fix this:
        (<19990825025653.A19065@samosa.mindspring.com> and
        <19990825022146.A10096@io.com>)

    * suEXEC doesn't work
        Ben Laurie's work to fix CGIs will also fix this.

    * Windows NT port isn't done
        Status: Bill is working on this through his MPM work, and Ryan
        is with APR.

    * Current 2.0 code is not tested on many Unix platforms. Make 2.0
      work on most, if not all the systems 1.3 did

        Status: Autoconf and APR will get us most of the way there.

    * The module API is a weird combination of the old table and the new
      hook system. Switch completely to the new hook system
        Status: Ben Laurie is working on this.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    (none listed)

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

Other features that need writing:

    * Switch to autoconf, et al. for configuration.

    * Use APR to get rid of more platform dependancies.
        Status: Ryan Bloom <rbb@raleigh.ibm.com> is working on this.

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: ?

    * Work on other MPMs. Possible MPMs discussed or in progress include:

      - David Reid's <abb37@dial.pipex.com> Beos MPM
          Status: in progress

      - Dean Gaudet's async MPM
          Status: ?

      - Zach Brown's <zab@zabbo.net> Linux siginfo MPM
          Status: ?

Documentation that needs writing:

    * The concept of MPMs, especially if we ship more than one MPM for a
      given platform

    * New directives in the various MPMs

    * API documentation
        Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
        (apache-2.0/htdocs/hooks.html)

Available Patches:

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve
     performance
       Status: These were written for 1.3, and are awaiting a port to
       2.0

Open issues:

   * What do we do about mod_proxy?

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?
