DAEDALUS 2.0 PROBLEMS:

    * mod_cgid and suexec have a problem co-existing.  suexec sees a null
      command string sometimes.

    * core dump from 20010418 running 2_0_16

      The input data (received in one read from TCP layer):

      GET /log4j/jakarta-log4j-1.1b2.zip HTTP/1.0
      Via: 1.0 MDRPRXY01, 1.0 NS2

      Referer: http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/download.html
      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

      The confusion was because apr_sendfile() returned APR_SUCCESS
      but zero bytes sent.  Presumably the FreeBSD kernel sendfile()
      did the same thing (not 100% sure).

      Also happened on 20010605...

      /usr/local/apache2b-vhost-trap/corefiles/httpd.core.12

      Again, it would seem that FreeBSD sendfile() returned rc 0 with
      no bytes sent.  (Other eyes welcome, of course... make sure you
      look at 2_0_16 sources.)

    * core dump from 20010521 and 20010529 running 2_0_16 - the "3030" problem

      /usr/local/apache/corefiles/httpd.core.6
      #0  0x80987e8 in apr_cvt (arg=1.3980432860952889e-76,

      #1  0x30303030 in ?? ()
      Cannot access memory at address 0x30303030. 

      In both coredumps the request is /server-status?auto.

      It is unclear whether the apr_*printf function was passed bad
      data or it screwed up on its own.  0x30 is '0'.  There is a
      string of 200-300 '0' characters in the dump, apparently
      overlaying enough of the stack to cause serious problems :)

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    WARNING: ALWAYS check srclib/apr/STATUS and srclib/apr-util/STATUS

    * cgi on all platforms is broken.  Specifically, with the addition of 
      filters, we have lost the ability to flush partially written buffers
      received from CGI scripts to the network. Apache 1.3 does a 
      non-blocking read on the pipe from the CGI. If bytes are present,
      Apache 1.3 keeps reading until one of three conditions are
      hit: 
      1. output buffer fills up (Apache should flush to network)
      2. receives an EOF on the pipe (ditto & cleanup)
      3. receives EWOULDBLOCK on the non-blocking read
      In case 3, Apache should flush the network buffer then do a
      blocking read on the pipe. Apache 2.0 always does a blocking read
      (in the content length filter), thus never gets the chance to
      flush the network i/o buffer.
      
    * Rotatelogs on Windows sometimes is not terminated when Apache
      goes down hard. When this occurs, Apache will not serve requests
      after it is restarted. The problem is that the old rotatelogs
      is holding the listening socket. netstat -an shows two listeners
      on the webserver port.

    * There is a bug in how we sort some hooks, at least the pre-config
      hook.  The first time we call the hooks, they are in the correct 
      order, but the second time, we don't sort them correctly.  Currently,
      the modules/http/config.m4 file has been renamed to 
      modules/http/config2.m4 to work around this problem, it should moved
      back when this is fixed.    rbb

    * Root all file systems with <Directory /> for WIN32/OS2/NW permissions 
        Status: patch brought forward from 1.3.14
                WIN32 and OS2 need review [William Rowe, Brian Harvard]

    * Win32: Get Apache working on Windows 95/98. The following work
	(at least) needs to be done:
	- winnt MPM: Fix 95/98 code paths in the winnt MPM. There is some NT
	specific code that is still not in NT only code paths
	- IOL binds to APR sendfile, implemented with TransmitFile, which 
        is not available on 95/98.
        - Document warning that OSR2 is required (for Crypt functions, in
        rand.c, at least.)

    * Win32: Test access logging with multiple threads. Will the 
	native file I/O calls serialize automagically like the 
	CRT calls or do we need to add region locking each time 
	we access the logs?
	Status: 

    * Win32: Complete the revamp the service environment and relocation
        into the WinNT MPM.  Changes ServerRoot service registry 
        parameter into ConfigArgs for multiple service startup parameters.
        Problems to fix in the revamp: -k shutdown/restart are broken, 
        signals are not being acknowledged.  Close window and shutdown 
        also seem out of sorts.
        OtherBill is working on this and will finish over the weekend.

    * We need a thread-safe resolver, at least on Unix.
        Status: The best known candidate would be something from
	BIND v9.
        Status: Greg asks, "why? doesn't gethostbyname_r() handle this?"

    * The AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter directives do not allow the
      administrator to remove or reorder filters.  Once a filter is added
      in a container, it is present in any subcontainers.  It can only be
      added to the filter chain after any filters specified in enclosing
      containers.

    * remove the --disable-shared from the subdir config of APR(UTIL)
      before the final release. (in fact, it might even be nice to
      allow for Apache config/build against an already-installed
      APR(UTIL))
      Note: we need to do a "make install" for APR(UTIL) so the shared
            libraries can be installed properly. We could also use that
            point to install include files (rather than have Apache
	    know everything that needs to be installed from the
	    sub-packages). The original impetus for doing the
	    disable-shared was because the shared lib wasn't getting
	    installed and a "make clean" in aprutil would make Apache
	    fail to load.

    * ap_vrprintf() needs to handle more than 4K
        Status: Greg volunteers

    * mod_dir should normally redirect ALL directory requests which do
      not include a trailing slash on the URI. However, if a "notes"
      flag is set (say, via BrowserMatch), this behavior will be
      disabled for non-GET requests.
        Status: Greg volunteers
        MsgId: <20010227104646.E2297@lyra.org>
        MsgId: <3A9C0097.9C83F07C@Golux.Com>

    * Usability: Sanitize the MPM config directives.  MaxClients in 
      the threaded MPM is totally misleading now as it has little to
      do with limiting the number of clients (it limits the number
      of child processes). Bill proposed nomenclature change to
      something like "StartWorkers, MaxWorkers, etc." that could 
      apply to most all the MPMs (with some notable exceptions).
      Bill would be happy with changing MaxClients to MaxServers
      to make it agree with the operation of the StartServers
      directive.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Port of mod_ssl to Apache 2.0:

      The current porting state is summarized in modules/ssl/README.  The next
      step is to figure out how the old three configuration contexts (global,
      per-server, per-directory) can be ported to Apache 2.0 (especially the
      global context which has to survive server restarts RSE still does not
      know how to port). Then the remaining source files (which depend on the
      configuration contexts) which are still tagged with "-" in
      modules/ssl/README can be ported. 
      
      One more thing to figure out is how and when mod_ssl can provide the
      interactive pass phrase dialog (in Apache 1.3 it used the first init
      round [where tty was still not detached] and skipped the second init
      round [where it was already detached]). Apache 2.0 requires (or already
      has?) an official hook where such tty-dialogs can be performed.

      RSE is on holiday until June 11th, 2001. After this he starts
      working on mod_ssl again and tries to make mod_ssl running inside
      Apache 2.0 by end of June. If anyone wants to help making mod_ssl
      running in the meantime, feel free to make your hands dirty inside
      modules/ssl/. Do whatever you think is appropriate to get it
      running. I've no objections of any kind, except: just do not
      remove any old functionality. Keep everything, even if it needs
      #if 0...endif wrapped to not make trouble for you.

    * Performance: Get the SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
      optimization working in threaded.  prefork's new design for how
      to notice data on the pod should be sufficient.

    * mod_tls is very specific to OpenSSL. Make the API calls
      more generic to support other encryption libraries.

    * Performance & Debug: Eliminate most (and perhaps all) of the 
      malloc/free calls in the bucket brigade code.  Need some 
      light weight memory management functions that allow freeing 
      memory (putting it back into a memory pool) when it is no 
      longer needed. Enabling simple debugging features like guard
      bands, double free detection, etc. would be cool but certainly
      not a hard requirement.
        Status: Cliff, David, et al have discussed using the blocks SMS
	        for this.  First step is to s/malloc/apr_sms_malloc/g, etc.
		We could then have a thread-private SMS that is pointed
		to by the conn_rec's or something so that all calls to
		the bucket create functions can pass in that SMS.  No locks
		required.  Should be fast... 

    * Eliminate unnecessary creation of pipes in mod_cgid

    * the autoconf setup should be fixed to default to using the 
      "Apache" layout from config.layout, and each variable settable
      in a layout should be overridable on the command line.  Plus,
      what we do right now just doesn't seem to fully fit into how autoconf
      works, eg. AC_PREFIX_DEFAULT issues.
        Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.20.0104031557420.20876-100000@alive.znep.com>

    * Combine log_child and piped_log_spawn. Clean up http_log.c.
      Common logging API.

    * Document mod_file_cache.

    * OS/2: Make mod_status work for spmt_os2 MPM.

    * Win32: Win9x console window still won't play nice with the
        close window, logoff and shutdown scenarios.
        Status: OtherBill will move the patch forward from 1.3.15, once we 
        get our other Win9x issues solved.

    * Win32: Add a simple hold console open patch (wait for close or
        the ESC key, with a nice message) if the server died a bad 
        death (non-zero exit code) in console mode.
        Status: OtherBill is bringing forward same ugly hack from 1.3.13

    * Platforms that do not support fork (primarily Win32 and AS/400)
      Architect start-up code that avoids initializing all the modules 
      in the parent process on platforms that do not support fork.

    * Win32: Migrate the MPM over to use APR thread/process calls. This
      would eliminate some code in the Win32 branch that essentially
      duplicates what is in APR.

    * There are still a number of places in the code where we are
      losing error status (i.e. throwing away the error returned by a
      system call and replacing it with a generic error code)

    * Mass vhosting version of suEXEC.

    * All DBMs suffer from confusion in support/dbmmanage (perl script) since 
        the dbmmanage employs the first-matched dbm format.  This is not
        necessarily the library that Apache was built with.  Aught to
        rewrite dbmmanage upon installation to bin/ with the proper library 
        for predictable mod_auth_db/dbm administration.

    * use apu_dbm in mod_auth_dbm
        Status: Greg +1 (low-priority volunteer)

    * Integrate mod_dav.
        Some additional items remaining:
	- case_preserved_filename stuff
	    (use the new canonical name stuff?)
	- find a new home for ap_text(_header)
	- is it possible to remove the DAV: namespace stuff from util_xml?
        - mod_dav_fs gets built static when mods-shared=most is specified.

    * ap_core_translate() and its use by mod_mmap_static and mod_file_cache
      are a bit wonky.  The function should probably be exposed as a utility 
      function (such as ap_translate_url2fs() or ap_validate_fs_url() or 
      something).  Another approach would be a new hook phase after
      "translate" which would allow the module to munge what the
      translation has decided to do.
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1

    * Explore use of a post-config hook for the code in http_main.c which
      calls ap_fixup_virutal_hosts(), ap_fini_vhost_config(), and
      ap_sort_hooks()  [to reduce the logic in main()]

    * read the config tree just once, and process N times (as necessary)

    * (possibly) use UUIDs in mod_unique_id and/or mod_usertrack

    * (possibly) port the bug fix for PR 6942 (segv when LoadModule is put
      into a VirtualHost container) to 2.0.

    * shift stuff to mod_core.h

    * APR-ize resolver stuff in mod_unique_id (Jeff volunteers)

    * callers of ap_run_create_request() should check the return value
      for failure (Doug volunteers)

    * when prefork bails out due to an initialization error in the detached
      process (e.g., mutex init failure), other children (cgid, at least) 
      are left hanging around

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * MaxRequestsPerChild measures connections, not requests.
        Until someone has a better way, we'll probably just rename it
        "MaxConnectionsPerChild".
    
    * Regex containers don't work in an intutive way
        Status: No one has come up with an efficient way to fix this
        behavior. Dean has suggested getting rid of regex containers
        completely.

    * SIGSEGV on Linux (glibc 2.1.2) isn't caught properly by a
      sigwaiting thread. We need to work around this, perhaps unless
      there is hope soon for a fixed glibc.

    * orig_ct in the byterange/multipart handling may not be
      needed. Apache 1.3 just never stashed "multipart" into
      r->content_type. We should probably follow suit since the
      byterange stuff doesn't want the rest of the code to see the
      multipart content-type; the other code should still think it is
      dealing with the <orig_ct> stuff.
        Status: Greg volunteers to investigate (esp. since he was most 
                likely the one to break it :-)

Other features that need writing:

    * Finish infrastructure in core for async MPMs
        Status: post 2.0

    * TODO in source -- just do an egrep on "TODO" and see what's there

Documentation that needs writing:
    * Mod_status docs are needed.

    * The concept of MPMs, especially if we ship more than one MPM for a
      given platform

    * New directives in the various MPMs and appropriate links from
	obsolete directives in core.html to the MPM documentation.

    * Revise manual/stopping.html and the last part of
	manual/misc/perf-tuning.html to take account of the MPMs.

    * API documentation
        Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
        (apache-2.0/htdocs/hooks.html)

    * Changes since 1.3.9 can be more easily seen in the commitlog file
         dev.apache.org:/home/cvs/CVSROOT/commitlogs/apache-2.0
      which includes some of Roy's comments when the changes were
      committed in rough change-sets by purpose.  Note that the commitlog
      does not show the contents of new files until later.

Available Patches:

   * Jon Travis's <jtravis@covalent.net> patch to deal with thread-safe
     issues with inet_ntoa.  See message <20001201163220.A12827@covalent.net>

		 so that we know exactly what is required.

     htpasswd actions due to a full /tmp volume (other programs may have

        Status:

   * Mike Abbott's <mja@trudge.engr.sgi.com> patches to improve

       2.0
 
   * Jim Winstead's <jimw@trainedmonkey.com> patch to add CookieDomain and 
     other small mod_usertrack features

   * Dan Rench's <drench@xnet.com> patch to add allow the errmsg and timefmt 
     of SSI's to be modified in the config file.  Patch is available in 
     PR6193

Open issues:

   * What do we do about mod_proxy?

   * Which MPMs will be included with Apache 2.0?
