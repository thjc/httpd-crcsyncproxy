<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Using Apache With Microsoft Windows</H1>

<P>This document explains how to compile, install, configure and run
   Apache 1.3b3 (or later) under Microsoft Windows. Please note that at
   this time, Windows support is entirely experimental, and is
   recommended only for experienced users. The Apache Group does not
   guarantee that this software will work as documented, or even at
   all. If you find any bugs, or wish to contribute in other ways, please
   use our <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html">bug reporting
   page.</A></P>

<P><STRONG>Warning: Apache on NT has not yet been optimized for performance.
Apache still performs best, and is most reliable on Unix platforms.  Over
time we will improve NT performance. Folks doing comparative reviews
of webserver performance are asked to compare against Apache
on a Unix platform such as Solaris, FreeBSD, or Linux.</STRONG></P>

<H2><A name="req">Requirements</A></H2>

<P>Apache 1.3b3 requires the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0<A HREF="#351">*</A>, or Windows 95.
  <LI>An Intel-based PC-compatible capable of running above OS (exact
      requirements unknown) with a connection to a TCP/IP network.
  <LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 or later.
</UL>

<P><SMALL><A name="351">*</A> Apache may run with Windows NT 3.5.1, but
   has not been tested.</SMALL></P>

<P>This documentation assumes good working knowledge of Microsoft
   Windows, Microsoft Visual C++, and the Apache web server (for
   Unix).</P>

<H2><A name="down">Downloading Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on the Apache
web server at <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A>.  This will
list the current release, any more recent alpha or beta-test release,
together with details of mirror web and anonymous ftp sites.</P>

<P>You can download Apache 1.3b3 in two different forms: an InstallShield-based
  <CODE>.exe</CODE> file which contains the precompiled binary, and a
  <CODE>.tar.gz</CODE> which contains the source code (and is also the
  regular Unix distribution). 

<H2><A name="comp">Compiling Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Compiling Apache requires Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 to be properly
   installed. It is easiest to compile with the command-line tools
   (nmake, etc...). Consult the VC++ manual to determine how to install
   them.</P>

<P>First, unpack the Apache distribution into an appropriate
   directory. Open a command-line prompt, and change to the
   <CODE>src</CODE> subdirectory of the Apache distribution.</P>

<P>The master Apache makefile instructions are contained in the
   <CODE>Makefile.nt</CODE> file. To compile Apache, simply use one of
   the following commands:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>nmake /f Makefile.nt _apacher</CODE> (release build)
<LI><CODE>nmake /f Makefile.nt _apached</CODE> (debug build)
</UL>

<P>These will both compile Apache. The latter will include debugging
   information in the resulting files, making it easier to find bugs and
   track down problems.</P>

<P>Apache can also be compiled using VC++'s Visual Studio development
   environment. Although compiling Apache in this manner is not as simple,
   it makes it possible to easily modify the Apache source, or to compile
   Apache if the command-line tools are not installed.</P>

<P>Project files (<CODE>.DSP</CODE>) are included for each of the
   portions of Apache. The three projects that are necessary for
   Apache to run are <CODE>Apache.dsp</CODE>, <CODE>ap/ap.dsp</CODE>,
   <CODE>regex/regex.dsp</CODE>, <CODE>ApacheCore.dsp</CODE> and
   <CODE>os/win32/ApacheOS.dsp</CODE>. The <CODE>src/win32</CODE>
   subdirectory contains project files for the optional modules (see
   below).</P>

<H2><A name="inst">Installing Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Once Apache has been compiled, it needs to be installed in its server
   root directory. The hard-coded default is the <CODE>\Apache</CODE>
   directory, on the current hard drive. Another directory may be used,
   but the files will need to be installed manually.</P>

<P>To install the files into the <CODE>\Apache</CODE> directory
   automatically, use one the following nmake commands (see above):</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>nmake /f Makefile.nt installr</CODE> (for release build)
<LI><CODE>nmake /f Makefile.nt installd</CODE> (for debug build)
</UL>

<P>This will install the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><CODE>\Apache\Apache.exe</CODE> - Apache executable
  <LI><CODE>\Apache\ApacheCore.dll</CODE> - Main Apache shared library
  <LI><CODE>\Apache\modules\ApacheModule*.dll</CODE> - Optional Apache
      modules (7 files)
  <LI><CODE>\Apache\conf</CODE> - Empty configuration directory
  <LI><CODE>\Apache\logs</CODE> - Empty logging directory
</UL>

<P>If you do not have nmake, or wish to install in a different directory,
   be sure to use a similar naming scheme.</P>

<H2><A name="use">Using Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>The first step is to set up Apache's configuration files. Default
   configuration files for Windows are located in the <CODE>conf</CODE>
   subdirectory in the Apache distribution, and are named
   <CODE>httpd.conf-dist-win</CODE>, <CODE>access.conf-dist-win</CODE>
   and <CODE>srm.conf-dist-win</CODE>. Move these into
   <CODE>\Apache\conf</CODE>, and rename them <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>,
   <CODE>access.conf</CODE> and <CODE>srm.conf</CODE>, respectively.</P>

<P>Configuring Apache is nearly identical to the Unix version of Apache,
   so most of the standard <A HREF="./">Apache documentation</A> is
   applicable. A few things are, however, different, or new:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><P>Because Apache for Windows is multithreaded, it does not use a
      separate process for each request, as Apache does with
      Unix. Instead there are usually only two Apache processes running:
      a parent process, and a child which handles the requests. Within
      the child each request is handled by a separate thread.
      <P>

      So the "process"-management directives are different:
      <P><A
         HREF="mod/core.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</A>
         - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests a
           process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix, a
           process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so if
           this is set, it is recommended that a very high number is
           used. The recommended default, <CODE>MaxRequestsPerChild
           0</CODE>, does not cause the process to ever exit.
      <P><A HREF="mod/core.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</A> -
         This directive is new, and tells the server how many threads it
         should use. This is the maximum number of connections the server
         can handle at once; be sure and set this number high enough for
         your site if you get a lot of hits. The recommended default is
         <CODE>ThreadsPerChild 50</CODE>.</P>
  <LI><P>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now must use
      Windows filenames instead of Unix ones. However, because Apache
      uses Unix-style names internally, you must use forward slashes, not
      backslashes. Drive letters can be used; if omitted, the drive with
      the Apache executable will be assumed.</P>
  <LI><P>Apache for Windows contains the ability to load modules at runtime,
      without recompiling the server. If Apache is compiled normally, it
      will install a number of optional modules in the
      <CODE>\Apache\modules</CODE> directory. To activate these, or other
      modules, the new <A HREF="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</A>
      directive must be used. For example, to active the status module,
      use the following (in addition to the status-activating directives
      in <CODE>access.conf</CODE>):</P>
<PRE>
    LoadModule status_module modules/ApacheModuleStatus.dll
</PRE>
      <P>Information on <A HREF="mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
         modules</A> is also available.</P>
  <LI><P>Apache can also load ISAPI Extensions (i.e., Internet Server
         Applications), such as those used by Microsoft's IIS, and other
         Windows servers. <A HREF="mod/mod_isapi.html">More information
         is available.</A>
</UL>

<P>Once Apache is configured correctly, it is nearly ready to be
run. However, we recommend you copy the <CODE>icons</CODE> and
<CODE>htdocs</CODE> subdirectories from the Apache distribution to
<CODE>\Apache</CODE>. The latter is especially important, as it contains
the document root (what the server actually serves).

<P>Apache can be executed in one of two ways, directly from the command
   line, or as a Windows NT service. To run it from the command line, use
   the following command:
<PRE>
    C:\Apache&gt; <STRONG>apache -s</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>Apache will then execute, and will remain running until it is
   exited. To use Apache as a Windows NT service, use the following:</P>
<PRE>
    C:\Apache&gt; <STRONG>apache -i</STRONG>
</PRE>
<P>Then open the Services control panel, and start the Apache service.</P>

<P>If you installed Apache in a server root other than
   <CODE>\Apache</CODE>, you must use the <CODE>-f</CODE> command-line
   option to specify the httpd.conf file, or the <CODE>-d</CODE> option
   to specify the server root.</P>
