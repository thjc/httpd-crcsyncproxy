<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Using Apache with Microsoft Windows</H1>

<P>This document explains how to install, configure and run
   Apache 2.0 under Microsoft Windows. If you find any bugs, or wish 
   to contribute in other ways, please use our 
   <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/bugs/">bug reporting page.</A></P>

<P>Most of this document assumes that you are installing Windows from a
   binary distribution. If you want to compile Apache yourself (possibly
   to help with development, or to track down bugs), see 
   <A HREF="win_compiling.html">Compiling Apache for Microsoft Windows</A>.

<H2><A NAME="req">Requirements</A></H2>

<P>Apache 2.0 is designed to run on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. The 
   binary installer will only work with the x86 family of processors, such
   as Intel's. Apache may also run on Windows 95 and 98, but these have not 
   been tested, and are never recommended for production servers. In all 
   cases TCP/IP networking must be installed.</P>

<P>If running on Windows 95, the "Winsock2" upgrade MUST BE INSTALLED. 
   "Winsock2" for Windows 95 is available 
   <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/">here</A>.</P>

<P>If running on NT 4.0, installing Service Pack 3 or 6 is recommended, as
   Service Pack 4 created known issues with TCPIP/WinSock integrity that
   were resolved in later Service Packs.</P>

<P><STRONG>Warning: as of alpha 2.0a4 Windows 95 (and possibly 98) do not
   run at all.  Please don't let that stop you, however, from contributing
   the fixes required to make that platform run successfully.</STRONG></P>

<H2><A NAME="down">Downloading Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on the
   Apache web server at <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/httpd">
   http://www.apache.org/httpd</A>.  This will list the current release, 
   any more recent alpha or beta-test releases, together with details of 
   mirror web and anonymous ftp sites.</P>

<P>You should download the version of Apache for Windows with the
   <CODE>.exe</CODE> extension. This is a single file containing Apache,
   ready to install and run. There may also be a <CODE>.zip</CODE> file
   containing the source code, to compile Apache yourself.  (If there is
   no <SAMP>.zip</SAMP> file, the source will be available in a
   <SAMP>.tar.gz</SAMP> file but this will contain Unix line endings. You
   will have to convert at least the <SAMP>.mak</SAMP> and
   <SAMP>.dsp</SAMP> files to have DOS line endings before MSVC will
   understand them).</P>

<P><STRONG>Notice: alpha versions are not distributed in binary form (as
   an .exe ready-to-run version).  You must use the Microsoft Visual C++
   compiler version 5 or 6 (bundled in VisualStudio 97 and 98).  Read 
   <A HREF="win_compiling.html">Compiling Apache for Microsoft Windows</A>
   for compilation/installation instructions.</STRONG></P>

<H2><A NAME="inst">Installing Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Run the Apache <SAMP>.exe</SAMP> file you downloaded above. This will
   ask for:</P>

<UL>

 <LI>the directory to install Apache into (the default is 
    <CODE>\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache</CODE> although you can
    change this to any other directory)

 <LI>the start menu name (default is "Apache Web Server")

 <LI>the installation type. The "Typical" option installs
    everything except the source code. The "Minimum" option does not
    install the manuals or source code. Choose the "Custom" install if
    you want to install the source code.

</UL>

<P>During the installation, Apache will configure the files in the
   <SAMP>conf</SAMP> directory for your chosen installation
   directory. However if any of the files in this directory already exist
   they will <STRONG>not</STRONG> be overwritten. Instead the new copy of
   the corresponding file will be left with the extension
   <SAMP>.default</SAMP>. So, for example, if
   <SAMP>conf\httpd.conf</SAMP> already exists it will not be altered,
   but the version which would have been installed will be left in
   <SAMP>conf\httpd.conf.default</SAMP>. After the installation has
   finished you should manually check to see what in new in the
   <SAMP>.default</SAMP> file, and if necessary update your existing
   configuration files.</P>

<P>Also, if you already have a file called <SAMP>htdocs\index.html</SAMP>
   then it will not be overwritten (no <SAMP>index.html.default</SAMP>
   file will be installed either). This should mean it a safe to install
   Apache over an existing installation (but you will have to stop the
   existing server running before doing the installation, then start the
   new one after the installation is finished).</P>

<P>After installing Apache, you should edit the configuration files in
   the <SAMP>conf</SAMP> directory as required. These files will be
   configured during the install ready for Apache to be run from the
   directory where it was installed, with the documents served from the
   subdirectory <SAMP>htdocs</SAMP>. There are lots of other options
   which should be set before you start really using Apache. However to
   get started quickly the files should work as installed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="run">Running Apache for Windows</A></H2>

There are two ways you can run Apache:

<UL>
 <LI>As a <A HREF="win_service.html#service">"service"</A> (available on 
    Windows NT/2000, and experimentally on Windows 95, 98 or ME).
    This is the best option if you want Apache to automatically start when you 
    machine boots, and to keep Apache running when you log-off.
 <LI>From a <A HREF="#cmdline">console window</A>. This MUST be used by any
    administrator to test before to attempting to run as a service.
</UL>

<P>To run Apache from a console window, select the "Start Apache as
   console app" option from the Start menu (in Apache 1.3.4 and earlier,
   this option was called "Apache Server"). This will open a console
   window and start Apache running inside it. The window will remain
   active until you stop Apache. To stop Apache running, either select
   the "Shutdown Apache console app" icon option from the Start menu
   (this is not available in Apache 1.3.4 or earlier), or see <A
   HREF="#signal">Signalling Console Apache when Running</A> for how
   to control Apache from the command line.</P>
   
<P>If the Apache console window closes immediately (or unexpectedly),
   run the "Command Prompt" from the Start Menu - Programs list.  Change
   to the folder to which you installed Apache, type the command apache,
   and read the error message.  Then change to the logs folder, and review
   the error.log file for configuration mistakes.  If you accepted the
   defaults when you installed Apache, the commands would be:</P>

<PRE>
  c:
  cd "\program files\apache group\apache"
  apache
  <SAMP>Wait for Apache to exit, or press Ctrl+C</SAMP>
  cd logs
  more &lt;error.log
</PRE>

<P><STRONG>Complete the steps above before you proceed to attempt to 
   start Apache as a Window NT/2000 service!</STRONG></P>

<P>To start Apache as a service, you first need to install it as a
   service. Multiple Apache services can be installed, each with a
   different name and configuration.  To install the default Apache
   service named "Apache", run the "Install Apache as Service (NT only)"
   option from the Start menu. Once this is done you can start the "Apache"
   service by opening the Services window (in the Control Panel), selecting Apache,
   then clicking on Start. Apache will now be running in the background. You
   can later stop Apache by clicking on Stop. As an alternative to using
   the Services window, you can start and stop the "Apache" service from the control
   line with:</P>

<PRE>
  NET START APACHE
  NET STOP APACHE
</PRE>

<P>See <A HREF="#signalsrv">Signalling Service Apache when Running</A>
   for more information on installing and controlling Apache services.</P>

<P><STRONG>Apache, unlike many other Windows NT/2000 services, logs any
   errors to it's own error.log file in the logs folder within the
   Apache server root folder.  You will <EM>not</EM> find Apache error 
   details in the Windows NT Event Log.</STRONG></P>

<P>After starting Apache running (either in a console window or as a
   service) if will be listening to port 80 (unless you changed the
   <SAMP>Port</SAMP>, <SAMP>Listen</SAMP> or <SAMP>BindAddress</SAMP>
   directives in the configuration files). To connect to the server and
   access the default page, launch a browser and enter this URL:</P>

<PRE>
  http://localhost/
</PRE>

<P>This should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the Apache
   manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in the
   <SAMP>error_log</SAMP> file in the <SAMP>logs</SAMP> directory.
   If your host isn't connected to the net, you may have to use
   this URL:</P>

<PRE>
  http://127.0.0.1/
</PRE>

<P>Once your basic installation is working, you should configure it
   properly by editing the files in the <SAMP>conf</SAMP> directory.
   Again, if you change the configuration of the Windows NT/2000
   service for Apache, first attempt to start it from the command
   line to assure that the service starts with no errors.</P>

<P>Because Apache <em>CANNOT</em> share the same port with another
   TCPIP application, you may need to stop or uninstall certain 
   services first.  These include (but are not limited to) other
   web servers, and firewall products such as BlackIce.  If you can
   only start Apache with these services disabled, reconfigure either
   Apache or the other product so that they do not listen on the
   same TCPIP ports.</P>

<H2><A NAME="use">Configuring Apache for Windows</A></H2>

<P>Apache is configured by files in the <SAMP>conf</SAMP>
   directory. These are the same as files used to configure the Unix
   version, but there are a few different directives for Apache on
   Windows. See the <A HREF="../">Apache documentation</A> for all the
   available directives.</P>

<P>The main differences in Apache for Windows are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><P>Because Apache for Windows is multithreaded, it does not use a
      separate process for each request, as Apache does with
      Unix. Instead there are usually only two Apache processes running:
      a parent process, and a child which handles the requests. Within
      the child each request is handled by a separate thread.
      <P>

      So the "process"-management directives are different:
      <P><A
         HREF="../mod/mpm_common.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</A>
         - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests a
           process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix, a
           process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so if
           this is set, it is recommended that a very high number is
           used. The recommended default, <CODE>MaxRequestsPerChild
           0</CODE>, does not cause the process to ever exit.
	   <STRONG>
           Warning: The server configuration file is reread when the
           new child process is started. If you have modified httpd.conf,
           the new child may not start or you may receive unexpected results.
	   </STRONG>
      <P><A HREF="../mod/mpm_common.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</A> -
         This directive is new, and tells the server how many threads it
         should use. This is the maximum number of connections the server
         can handle at once; be sure and set this number high enough for
         your site if you get a lot of hits. The recommended default is
         <CODE>ThreadsPerChild 50</CODE>.</P>
  <LI><P>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now must use
      Windows filenames instead of Unix ones. However, because Apache
      uses Unix-style names internally, you must use forward slashes, not
      backslashes. Drive letters can be used; if omitted, the drive with
      the Apache executable will be assumed.</P>
  <LI><P>Apache for Windows contains the ability to load modules at runtime,
      without recompiling the server. If Apache is compiled normally, it
      will install a number of optional modules in the
      <CODE>\Apache\modules</CODE> directory. To activate these, or other
      modules, the new <A HREF="../mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</A>
      directive must be used. For example, to active the status module,
      use the following (in addition to the status-activating directives
      in <CODE>access.conf</CODE>):</P>
<PRE>
    LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
</PRE>
      <P>Information on <A HREF="../mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
         modules</A> is also available.</P>
  <LI><P>Apache can also load ISAPI Extensions (<EM>i.e.</EM>, Internet Server
         Applications), such as those used by Microsoft's IIS, and other
         Windows servers. <A HREF="../mod/mod_isapi.html">More information
         is available.</A>  Note that Apache <em>CANNOT</em> load ISAPI
		 Filters.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="service">Running Apache for Windows as a Service</A></H2>

<P><STRONG>Note: The -n option to specify a service name is only available
   with Apache 1.3.7 and later.  Earlier versions of Apache only support
   the default service name 'Apache'.</STRONG></P>

<P>You can install Apache as a Windows NT service as follows:</p>

<PRE>
    apache -k install -n "service name"
</PRE>

  <p>To install a service to use a particular configuration, specify the
  configuration file when the service is installed:</p>

<PRE>
    apache -k install -n "service name" -f "\my server\conf\my.conf"
</PRE>

  <p>To remove an Apache service, use</p>

<PRE>
    apache -k uninstall -n "service name"
</PRE>

  <p>The default "service name", if one is not specified, is "Apache".</P>

<P>Once a service is installed, you can use the <SAMP>-n</SAMP> option, in 
   conjunction with other options, to refer to a service's configuration 
   file.  For example:</P>

<P>To test a service's configuration file:</P>

<PRE>
    apache -n "service name" -t
</PRE>

<P>To start a console Apache using a service's configuration file:</P>

<PRE>
    apache -n "service name"
</PRE>

<P><STRONG>Important Note on service dependencies:</STRONG></P>

<P>Prior to Apache release 1.3.13, the dependencies required to
   successfully start an installed service were not configured.
   After installing a service using earlier versions of Apache, 
   you must follow these steps:

<PRE>
    Run regedt32
    Select <U>W</U>indow - "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine" from the menu
    Double-click to open the SYSTEM, then the CurrentControlSet keys
    Scroll down and click on the Apache servicename
    Select <U>E</U>dit - Add <U>V</U>alue... from the menu
    Fill in the Add Value dialog with 
        <U>V</U>alue Name: DependOnGroup 
        <U>D</U>ata Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
        and click OK
    Leave the Multi-String Editor dialog empty and click OK
    Select <U>E</U>dit - Add <U>V</U>alue... from the menu
    Fill in the Add Value dialog with 
        <U>V</U>alue Name: DependOnService
        <U>D</U>ata Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
        and click OK
    Type the following list (one per line) in the Multi-String Editor dialog
        Tcpip
        Afd
        and click OK
</PRE>

<P>If you are using COM or DCOM components from a third party module, ISAPI,
   or other add-in scripting technologies such as ActiveState Perl, you may
   also need to add the entry Rpcss to the DependOnService list.  To avoid
   exposing the TCP port 135 when it is unnecessary, Apache does not create
   that entry upon installation.  Follow the directions above to find or 
   create the DependOnService value, double click that value if it already 
   exists, and add the Rpcss entry to the list.</P>

<H2><A NAME="cmdline">Running Apache for Windows from the Command Line</A></H2>

<P>The Start menu icons and the NT Service manager can provide a simple
   interface for administering Apache. But in some cases it is easier to
   work from the command line.</P>

<P>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will find the
   configuration files.  You can specify a configuration file on the command line
   in two ways:</p>

<UL>
	<LI>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration file
</UL>

<PRE>    apache -f "c:\my server\conf\my.conf"
    apache -f test\test.conf</PRE>

<UL>
	<LI>-n specifies the configuration file of an installed Apache service (Apache 1.3.7 and later)
</UL>

<PRE>    apache -n "service name"</PRE>

   <p>In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the configuration file.</P>

<P>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f or -n, Apache will
   use the file name compiled into the server, usually "conf/httpd.conf".  Invoking
   Apache with the -V switch will display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE.
   Apache will then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in this order:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.
	<LI>The -d switch on the command line.
	<LI>Current working directory
	<LI>A registry entry, created if you did a binary install.
	<LI>The server root compiled into the server.
</UL>

<P>The server root compiled into the server is usually "/apache".
   invoking apache with the -V switch will display this value
   labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</P>

<P>When invoked from the start menu, Apache is usually passed no arguments,
   so using the registry entry is the preferred technique for console Apache.</P>

<P>During a binary installation, a version-specific registry key is created 
   in the Windows registry:

<PRE>
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apache Group\Apache\1.3.7

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apache Group\Apache\2.0a3
</PRE>

<P>This key is compiled into the server and can enable you to test 
   new versions without affecting the current version.  Of course
   you must take care not to install the new version on top of the
   old version in the file system.</P>

<P>If you did not do a binary install then Apache will in some
   scenarios complain that about the missing registry key.  This
   warning can be ignored if it otherwise was able to find its
   configuration files.</P>

<P>The value of this key is the "ServerRoot" directory, containing the
   <SAMP>conf</SAMP> directory. When Apache starts it will read the
   <SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP> file from this directory. If this file
   contains a <SAMP>ServerRoot</SAMP> directive which is different from
   the directory obtained from the registry key above, Apache will forget
   the registry key and use the directory from the configuration file.
   If you copy the Apache directory or configuration files to a new
   location it is vital that you update the <SAMP>ServerRoot</SAMP>
   directory in the <SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP> file to the new location.

<P>To run Apache from the command line as a console application, use the
   following command:</p>

<PRE>
    apache 
</PRE>

   <p>Apache will execute, and will remain running until it is stopped by pressing
   control-C.</P>

<H2><A NAME="signalsrv">Signalling Service Apache when running</A></H2>

<P>On Windows NT, multiple instances of Apache can be run as services.
   Signal an Apache service to start, restart, or shutdown as follows:</P>

<PRE>
    apache -n "service name" -k start
    apache -n "service name" -k restart
    apache -n "service name" -k shutdown
</PRE>

<P>In addition, you can use the native NT NET command to
   start and stop Apache services as follows:</P>

<PRE>
    NET START "service name"
    NET STOP "service name"
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="signal">Signalling Console Apache when running</A></H2>

<P>On Windows 95, Apache runs as a console application. You can tell a
   running Apache to stop by opening another console window and typing:</P>

<PRE>
    apache -k shutdown
</PRE>

<P>This should be used instead of pressing Control-C in the running
   Apache console window, because it lets Apache end any current
   transactions and cleanup gracefully.</P>

<P>You can also tell Apache to restart. This makes it re-read the
   configuration files. Any transactions in progress are allowed to
   complete without interruption. To restart Apache, run</P>

<PRE>
    apache -k restart
</PRE>

<P>Note for people familiar with the Unix version of Apache: these
   commands provide a Windows equivalent to <CODE>kill -TERM
   <EM>pid</EM></CODE> and <CODE>kill -USR1 <EM>pid</EM></CODE>. The command
   line option used, <CODE>-k</CODE>, was chosen as a reminder of the
   "kill" command used on Unix.</P>
