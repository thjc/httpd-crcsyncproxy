#!/usr/local/bin/perl5

# This is a very simple Perl script to expand server-side includes
# in the directory it is run, and direct subdirectories. It will
# work only on SSI directives of the form
#
# <!--#include virtual="filename" -->
#
# Filename must be relative to the directory the file appears in.
