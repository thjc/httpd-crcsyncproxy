	What to do in case of problems</A></H3>
  <P>
  If you are having trouble with your Apache server software, you should
  take the following steps:
  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the errorlog!</STRONG>
    <P>
    Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a problem.  In many
    cases, it will provide some details by writing one or messages to
    the server error log.  Sometimes this is enough for you to diagnose
    &amp; fix the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the like).
    The default location of the error log is
    <SAMP>/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log</SAMP>, but see the
    <A HREF="../mod/core.html#errorlog"><SAMP>ErrorLog</SAMP></A>
    directive in your config files for the location on your server.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the
    <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">FAQ</A>!</STRONG>
    <P>
    The latest version of the Apache Frequently-Asked Questions list can
    always be found at the main Apache web site.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the Apache bug database</STRONG>
    <P>
    Most problems that get reported to The Apache Group are recorded in
    the
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/">bug database</A>.
    <EM><STRONG>Please</STRONG> check the existing reports, open
    <STRONG>and</STRONG> closed, before adding one.</EM>  If you find
    that your issue has already been reported, please <EM>don't</EM> add
    a &quot;me, too&quot; report.  If the original report isn't closed
    yet, we suggest that you check it periodically.  You might also
    consider contacting the original submitter, because there may be an
    email exchange going on about the issue that isn't getting recorded
    in the database.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Ask in the <SAMP>comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</SAMP>
    or <SAMP>comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows</SAMP> USENET
    newsgroup (as appropriate for the platform you use).</STRONG>
    <P>
    A lot of common problems never make it to the bug database because
    there's already high Q&amp;A traffic about them in the
    <A HREF="news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix"
    ><SAMP>comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</SAMP></A>
    newsgroup.  Many Apache users, and some of the developers, can be
    found roaming its virtual halls, so it is suggested that you seek
    wisdom there.  The chances are good that you'll get a faster answer
    there than from the bug database, even if you <EM>don't</EM> see
    your question already posted.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>If all else fails, report the problem in the bug
    database</STRONG>
    <P>
    If you've gone through those steps above that are appropriate and
    have obtained no relief, then please <EM>do</EM> let The Apache
    Group know about the problem by
    <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">logging a bug report</A>.
    </P>
    <P>
    If your problem involves the server crashing and generating a core
    dump, please include a backtrace (if possible).  As an example,
    </P>
    <P>
    <DL>
     <DD><CODE># cd <EM>ServerRoot</EM><BR>
      # dbx httpd core<BR>
      (dbx) where</CODE>
     </DD>
    </DL>
    <P></P>
    <P>
    (Substitute the appropriate locations for your
    <SAMP>ServerRoot</SAMP> and your <SAMP>httpd</SAMP> and
    <SAMP>core</SAMP> files.  You may have to use <CODE>gdb</CODE>
    instead of <CODE>dbx</CODE>.)
    </P>
   </LI>
  </OL>

 <H3><A NAME="support">Whom do I contact for support?</A></H3>
  <P>
  There is no official support for Apache. None of the developers want to
  be swamped by a flood of trivial questions that can be resolved elsewhere.
  Bug reports and suggestions should be sent <EM>via</EM>
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/bug_report.html">the bug report page</A>.
  Other questions should be directed to the
  <A HREF="news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix"
  >comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</A> or <A HREF=
  "news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows"
  >comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows</A>
  newsgroup (as appropriate for the platform you use), where some of the 
  Apache team lurk, in the company of many other httpd gurus who 
  should be able to help.
  </P>
  <P>
  Commercial support for Apache is, however, available from a number
  of third parties.
  </P>
