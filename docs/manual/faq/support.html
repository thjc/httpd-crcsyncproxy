	What to do in case of problems</A></H3>
  <P>
  If you are having trouble with your Apache server software, you should
  take the following steps:
  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the errorlog!</STRONG>
    <P>
    Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a problem.  In many
    cases, it will provide some details by writing one or messages to
    the server error log.  Sometimes this is enough for you to diagnose
    &amp; fix the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the like).
    The default location of the error log is
    <SAMP>/usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log</SAMP>, but see the
    <A HREF="../mod/core.html#errorlog"><SAMP>ErrorLog</SAMP></A>
    directive in your config files for the location on your server.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the
    <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/">FAQ</A>!</STRONG>
    <P>
    The latest version of the Apache Frequently-Asked Questions list can
    always be found at the main Apache web site.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the Apache bug database</STRONG>
    <P>
    Most problems that get reported to The Apache Group are recorded in
    the
    <A HREF="http://bugs.apache.org/">bug database</A>.
    <EM><STRONG>Please</STRONG> check the existing reports, open
    <STRONG>and</STRONG> closed, before adding one.</EM>  If you find
    that your issue has already been reported, please <EM>don't</EM> add
    a &quot;me, too&quot; report.  If the original report isn't closed
    yet, we suggest that you check it periodically.  You might also
    consider contacting the original submitter, because there may be an
    email exchange going on about the issue that isn't getting recorded
    in the database.
    </P>
   </LI>
   <LI><STRONG><a name="user-support">Ask in a user support forum</a></STRONG>
    <P>Apache has an active community of users who are willing to 
    share their knowledge.  Participating in this community is
    usually the best and fastest way to get answers to your
    questions and problems.</P>

    <P>
    If you've gone through those steps above that are appropriate and
    have obtained no relief, then please <EM>do</EM> let The Apache
    Group know about the problem by
    <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">logging a bug report</A>.
    </P>
    <P>
    If your problem involves the server crashing and generating a core
    dump, please include a backtrace (if possible).  As an example,
    </P>
    <P>
    <DL>
     <DD><CODE># cd <EM>ServerRoot</EM><BR>
      # dbx httpd core<BR>
      (dbx) where</CODE>
     </DD>
    </DL>
    <P></P>
    <P>
    (Substitute the appropriate locations for your
    <SAMP>ServerRoot</SAMP> and your <SAMP>httpd</SAMP> and
    <SAMP>core</SAMP> files.  You may have to use <CODE>gdb</CODE>
    instead of <CODE>dbx</CODE>.)

 <H3><A NAME="support">Whom do I contact for support?</A></H3> 

 <P>With several million users and fewer than forty volunteer
 developers, we cannot provide personal support for Apache.  For free
 support, we suggest participating in a <a href="#user-support">user
 forum</a>.</p>

 <p>Professional, commercial support for Apache is available from 
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/info/support.cgi">a number of
  companies</a>.</p>
