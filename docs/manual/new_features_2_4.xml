      <dt>Check Configuration Hook Added</dt>

      <dd>A new hook, <code>check_config</code>, has been added which runs
          between the <code>pre_config</code> and <code>open_logs</code>
          hooks.  It also runs before the <code>test_config</code> hook
          when the <code>-t</code> option is passed to
          <program>httpd</program>.  The <code>check_config</code> hook
          allows modules to review interdependent configuration directive
          values and adjust them while messages can still be logged to the
          console.  The user can thus be alerted to misconfiguration problems
          before the core <code>open_logs</code> hook function redirects
          console output to the error log.</dd>

      <dt>Expression Parser Added</dt>

      <dd>We now have a general-purpose expression parser, whose API is
          exposed in <var>ap_expr.h</var>.  This is adapted from the
          expression parser previously implemented in
          <module>mod_include</module>.</dd>

      <dt>Authorization Logic Containers</dt>

      <dd>Advanced authorization logic may now be specified using the
          <directive module="mod_authz_core">Require</directive> directive
          and the related container directives, such as
          <directive module="mod_authz_core"
          type="section">RequireAll</directive>, all
          provided by the <module>mod_authz_core</module> module.</dd>
