Some things that need to be done with the LaTeX transforms:

- Finish special pages:
  * quick reference
  * faq
  [This is a good job for someone who wants to get familiar with LaTeX,
   since you can just take the existing LaTeX as an example, and combine
   it with the xslt stuff under style/xsl/.]

- Tables
  Add <columnspec> to xml files.

- Images

  A quick search makes me believe that pdftex will not handle gifs.
  It probably will handle png.

- Fix quotes

  In LaTeX, quotes should be like ``This''.  This may
  not be feasible for us, in which case we could simply replace
  " with \texttt{"} or something, so that the quotes are all straight.

- Fix page references on "external" directives
  (<directivesynopsis location=...)

- External URL references containing a "#" are broken.

- Hundreds of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Fix build system

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable and add licenses.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Translations.
