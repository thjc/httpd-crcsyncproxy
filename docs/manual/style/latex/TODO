Some things that need to be done with the LaTeX transforms:

- Finish special pages:
  * module index
  * directive index
  * quick reference
  * faq
  [This is a good job for someone who wants to get familiar with LaTeX,
   since you can just take the existing LaTeX as an example, and combine
   it with the xslt stuff under style/xsl/.]

- Fix tables

  Perhaps we need to add some xml hints about the size of different
  columns in the source files.

  Here is a proposal:

  xml:
  <table>
  <columnspec><column width=".2"/><column width=".2"/><column width=".6"/>
  </columnspec>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
  </table>

  latex:
  \begin{tabular}{lll} % number of "l"s matches the number of <column>s.
  \begin{minipage}{.2\linewidth}
  1
  \end{minipage} &
  \begin{minipage}{.2\linewidth}
  2
  \end{minipage} &
  \begin{minipage}{.6\linewidth}
  3
  \end{minipage} \\ % And continue in the same way if there are more rows
  \end{tabular}

  This should be enough to get an xsl expert started.

- Images

  A quick search makes me believe that pdftex will not handle gifs.
  It probably will handle png.

- Fix quotes

  In LaTeX, quotes should be like ``This''.  This may
  not be feasible for us, in which case we could simply replace
  " with \texttt{"} or something, so that the quotes are all straight.

- Add hyperlinks for directives and modules (for online use only,
  not page number references).  This will require the \hyperlink
  and \hypertarget macros from hyperref.  see:
  http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#QQ1-1-3

- Hundreds of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Fix build system

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable and add licenses.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Translations.
