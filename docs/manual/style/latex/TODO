Some things that need to be done with the LaTeX transforms:

- Tables
  Add <columnspec> to xml files.

- Images

  A quick search makes me believe that pdftex will not handle gifs.
  It probably will handle png.

- Hundreds of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Fix build system

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable and add licenses.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Speed up the XSLT tranform.

- Translations.
