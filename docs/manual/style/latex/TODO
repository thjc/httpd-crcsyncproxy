Some things that need to be done with the LaTeX transforms:

- Finish special pages:
  * module index
  * directive index
  * quick reference
  * faq

- Fix tables

  Perhaps we need to add some xml hints about the size of different
  columns in the source files.  For example:
  <table><columnlist><column width="20%"/><column width="80%"/></columnlist>
  <tr><td>...

- Images

  A quick search makes me believe that pdftex will not handle gifs.
  It probably will handle png.

- Fix quotes

  In LaTeX, quotes should be like ``This''.  This may
  not be feasible for us, in which case we could simply replace
  " with \texttt{"} or something, so that the quotes are all straight.

- Add hyperlinks for directives and modules (for online use only,
  not page number references).

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Hundreds of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Fix build system

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable.
