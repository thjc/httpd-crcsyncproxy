<p>The following programs are simple support programs included with
the Apache HTTP Server which do not have their own manual pages.</p>


<h2><a name="log_server_status">log_server_status</a></h2>

<p>This Perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by something
like cron.  It connects to the server and downloads the status
information.  It reformats the information to a single line and logs
it to a file.  Adjust the variables at the top of the script
to specify the location of the resulting logfile.</p>

<h2><a name="split-logfile">split-logfile</a></h2>

<p>This Perl script will take a combined Web server access
log file and break its contents into separate files.
It assumes that the first field of each line is the
virtual host identity (put there by "%v"), and that
the logfiles should be named that+".log" in the current
directory.</p>

<p>The combined log file is read from stdin. Records read
will be appended to any existing log files.</p>
