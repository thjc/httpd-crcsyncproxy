<p>A <em>filter</em> is a process which is applied to data that is
sent or received by the server.  Data sent by clients to the server
is processed by <em>input filters</em> while data sent by the
server to the client is processed by <em>output filters</em>.
Multiple filters can be applied to the data, and the order
of the filters can be explicitly specified.  In addition,
since filters apply to all content, they allow for flexible
manipulation of data such as processing the output of 
CGI scripts for Server Side Includes.</p>

<p>The set of filters which apply to data can be manipulated
with the <code>SetInputFilter</code> and <code>SetOutputFilter</code>
directives.</p>

<p>The only filter currently included with the Apache distribution
is the <code>INCLUDE</code> filter which is provided by 
<a href="mod/mod_include.html">mod_include</a> to process output
for Server Side Includes.  There is also an experimental module
called <a href="mod/mod_ext_filter.html">mod_ext_filter</a>
which allows for external programs to be defined as filters.</p>
