    <title>Core Enhancements</title>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Unix Threading</strong></dt>

      <dd>On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache can
      now run in a hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This
      improves scalability for many, but not all configurations.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New Build System</strong></dt>

      <dd>The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be
      based on autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache's
      configuration system more similar to that of other
      packages.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Multiprotocol Support</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now has some of the infrastructure in place to
      support serving multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written
      as an example.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Better support for non-Unix
      platforms</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache 2.0 is faster and more stable on non-Unix
      platforms such as BeOS, OS/2, and Windows. With the
      introduction of platform-specific <a
      href="mpm.html">multi-processing modules</a> (MPMs) and the
      Apache Portable Runtime (APR), these platforms are now
      implemented in their native API, avoiding the often buggy and
      poorly performing POSIX-emulation layers.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New Apache API</strong></dt>

      <dd>The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0.
      Many of the module-ordering/-priority problems from 1.3 should
      be gone. 2.0 does much of this automatically, and module ordering
      is now done per-hook to allow more flexibility. Also, new calls
      have been added that provide additional module capabilities
      without patching the core Apache server.</dd>

      <dt><strong>IPv6 Support</strong></dt>

      <dd>On systems where IPv6 is supported by the underlying
      Apache Portable Runtime library, Apache gets IPv6 listening
      sockets by default. Additionally, the <directive
      module="mpm_common">Listen</directive>, <directive module="core"
      >NameVirtualHost</directive>, and <directive module="core"
      >VirtualHost</directive> directives support
      IPv6 numeric address strings (e.g., "Listen
      [fe80::1]:8080").</dd>

      <dt><strong>Filtering</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache modules may now be written as filters which act on
      the stream of content as it is delivered to or from the
      server. This allows, for example, the output of CGI scripts
      to be parsed for Server Side Include directives using the
      INCLUDES filter in mod_include.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Multilanguage Error Responses</strong></dt>

      <dd>Error response messages to the browser are now provided in 
      several languages, using SSI documents. They may be customized 
      by the administrator to achieve a consistent look and feel.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Simplified configuration</strong></dt>

      <dd>Many confusing directives have been simplified. The often
      confusing Port and BindAddress directives are gone; only the
      Listen directive is used for IP address binding; the
      ServerName directive specifies the server name and port number
      only for redirection and vhost recognition.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Native Windows NT Unicode Support</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache 2.0 on Windows NT now uses utf-8 for all filename
      encodings. These directly translate to the underlying Unicode
      file system, providing multilanguage support for all Windows 
      NT-based installations, including Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
      <em>This support does not extend to Windows 95, 98 or ME, which 
      continue to use the machine's local codepage for filesystem 
      access.</em></dd>
    </dl>

  <section id="module">
    <title>Module Enhancements</title>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>mod_ssl</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This module is an interface
      to the SSL/TLS encryption protocols provided by
      OpenSSL.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_dav</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This module implements the HTTP
      Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) specification for
      posting and maintaining web content.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_auth_digest</strong></dt>

      <dd>Includes additional support for session caching across
      processes using shared memory.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_charset_lite</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This experimental module allows
      for character set translation or recoding.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_file_cache</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This module includes the
      functionality of mod_mmap_static in Apache 1.3, plus adds
      further caching abilities.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_headers</strong></dt>

      <dd>This module is much more flexible in Apache 2.0. It can
      now modify request headers used by mod_proxy, and it can
      conditionally set response headers.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_proxy</strong></dt>

      <dd>The proxy module has been completely rewritten to take advantage
      of the new filter infrastructure and to implement a more
      reliable, HTTP/1.1 compliant proxy. In addition, new
      &lt;Proxy&gt; configuration sections provide more readable
      (and internally faster) control of proxied sites; overloaded 
      &lt;Directory "proxy:..."&gt; configuration are not supported. The
      module is now divided into specific protocol support modules 
      including proxy_connect, proxy_ftp and proxy_http.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_negotiation</strong></dt>

      <dd>A new <directive module="mod_negotiation"
      >ForceLanguagePriority</directive> directive can be used to assure that
      the client receives a single document in all cases, rather than
      NOT ACCEPTABLE or MULTIPLE CHOICES responses. In addition, the
      negotiation and MultiViews algorithms have been cleaned up to
      provide more consistent results and a new form of type map that
      can include document content is provided.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_autoindex</strong></dt>

      <dd>Autoindex'ed directory listings can now be configured to 
      use HTML tables for cleaner formatting, and allow finer-grained
      control of sorting, including version-sorting, and wildcard
      filtering of the directory listing.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_include</strong></dt>

      <dd>New directives allow the default start and end tags for SSI elements
      to be changed and allow for error and time format configuration
      to take place in the main configuration file rather than in the
      SSI document. Results from regular expression parsing and grouping
      (now based on Perl's regular expression syntax) can be retrieved
      using mod_include's variables $0 .. $9.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_auth_dbm</strong></dt>

      <dd>Now supports multiple types of DBM-like databases using the
      <directive module="mod_auth_dbm">AuthDBMType</directive>
      directive.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_auth_db</strong></dt>

      <dd>Has been removed in favor of mod_auth_dbm with the AuthDBMType
      directive.</dd>
