<title>Upgrading to 2.1 from 2.0</title>

<summary>
  <p>In order to assist folks upgrading, we maintain a document
  describing information critical to existing Apache users. These
  are intended to be brief notes, and you should be able to find
  more information in either the <a
  href="new_features_2_2.html">New Features</a> document, or in
  the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file.</p>

  <p>This document describes only the changes from 2.0 to 2.2.  If you
  are upgrading from version 1.3, you should also consult the <a
  href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html">1.3 to 2.0
  upgrading document.</a></p>

    <title>Run-Time Configuration Changes</title>

    <ul>
      <li>The config file <code>httpd.conf</code> distributed with the
      Apache HTTP Server has been greatly simplified by removing all
      but the most essential configuration settings.  A set of example
      configuration settings for more advanced features is present in
      the <code>conf/extra/</code> directory of the installed
      server.</li>

      <li>The <program>apachectl</program> option
      <code>startssl</code> is no longer available.  To enable ssl
      support, you should edit <code>httpd.conf</code> to include the
      relevant <module>mod_ssl</module> directives and then use
      <code>apachectl start</code> to start the server.  An example
      configuration to activate <module>mod_ssl</module> has been included
      in <code>conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf</code>.</li>

      <li>The default setting of <directive
      module="core">UseCanonicalName</directive> is now
      <code>Off</code>.  If you did not have this directive in your
      config file, you can add <code>UseCanonicalName On</code> to
      retain the old behavior.</li>

      <li>The module <module>mod_userdir</module> will no longer act
      on requests unless a <directive
      module="mod_userdir">UserDir</directive> directive specifying a
      directory name is present in the config file.  To restore the
      old default behavior, place the directive <code>UserDir
      public_html</code> in your config file.</li>
