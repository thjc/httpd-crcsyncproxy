Apache HTTP Server 2.0 Documentation Status File.

If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to 
apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.

- Merging of changes in 1.3.
   - There have been many changes in the 1.3 docs which haven't
     been propagated into 2.0.
     Things which need to be merged:
         manual/howto/*

- Reorganizing.
   - Joshua thinks this is a good opportunity to think about directory
     structure.  
       Proposal:
         Create manual/FAQ which contains all the manual/misc/FAQ* docs

- Cleaning.
   - We could use a list of all the docs that can be axed out of 2.0
     because they are redundant or irrelevant.
        Status: Rich <rbowen@rcbowen.com> is going to look at this.
	Some suggestions on files to axe.  Feel free to comment.
          manual/bind.html (mostly now documented in server-wide.html)
          manual/cgi-path.html (should be documented in mod_cgi.html instead)
          manual/multi-logs.html (documented in mod_log_config.html)
          manual/process-model.html (documented in MPMs, eventually)
          manual/mod/index-bytype.html

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup.  For example,
     manual/invoking.html could use a big cleanup with lots of the
     "this changed in 1.3.10" stuff removed.


- New build process.
   - The new build process is autoconf based, so manual/install.html
     will need to be completely rewritten.  Someone with enough
     patience could probably figure out most of the important stuff
     by trial and error.
        Status: Ryan's "Building and Installing Apache 2.0" might be
                a starting place.  Rich <rbowen@rcbown.com> is interested
                in collaborating with someone else on this.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.
        Status: Ryan has two ApacheToday articles which may be useful 
                for this.

- Translations
        Status: ???


- The STATUS Document.
   - Is this the best organization/format?  What else needs to be
     added?  Should this be auto-posted to apache-docs?
