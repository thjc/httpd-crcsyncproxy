Apache HTTP Server 2.0 Documentation Status File.

If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to 
apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

- XHTML conversion
        Status: James A Sutherland <jas88@cam.ac.uk> was going
                to spearhead this.  Some work is still needed
                to determine what the SSIs should look like.

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.
          - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
          - perchild MPM needs some docs.

- Merging of changes in 1.3.
   - There have been many changes in the 1.3 docs which haven't
     been propagated into 2.0.
     Things which need to be merged:

- Cleaning.
   - We could use a list of all the docs that can be axed out of 2.0
     because they are redundant or irrelevant.
        Status: Rich <rbowen@rcbowen.com> is going to look at this.
	Some suggestions on files to axe.  Feel free to comment.
          manual/cgi-path.html (should be documented in mod_cgi.html instead)
          manual/process-model.html (documented in MPMs, eventually)
          platform/perf-* (are these relevant anymore?)


   - Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
        Status:  What docs still need to be touched here?
                 - invoking.html has had a first-pass cleaning done.
                 - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
                 - misc/FAQ.html - some old questions could be remove
                                 - is a new format in order?
                 - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
                 - misc/stopping.html
                 - dso.html
                 - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
                 - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient
                 - howto/* - some syntax has changed in 2.0 due to 
                             filtering and mod_cgid

- New build process.
   - The new build process is autoconf based, so manual/install.html
     will need to be completely rewritten.  Someone with enough
     patience could probably figure out most of the important stuff
     by trial and error.
        Status: Ryan's "Building and Installing Apache 2.0" might be
                a starting place.  Rich <rbowen@rcbown.com> is interested
                in collaborating with someone else on this.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.
        Status: Ryan has two ApacheToday articles which may be useful 
                for this.
	        New features which need documentation:
                    - filters !!!

- Translations
        Status: ???


- The STATUS Document.
   - Is this the best organization/format?  What else needs to be
     added?  Should this be auto-posted to apache-docs?
