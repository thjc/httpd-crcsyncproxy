<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Unix Threading</STRONG>
<DD>On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache can now run in a
    hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This should improve
    scalability. 

<DT><STRONG>New Build System</STRONG>
<DD>The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be based on
    autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache's configuration system more
    similar to that of other packages.

<DT><STRONG>Multiprotocol Support</STRONG>
<DD>Apache now has some of the infrastructure in place to support serving
    multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written as an example.

<DT><STRONG>Better support for non-Unix platforms</STRONG>
<DD>Apache 2.0 is faster and more stable on non-Unix platforms such as
    BeOS, OS/2, and Windows. With the introduction of platform-specific
    multiprocessing modules (MPM) and the Apache Portable Runtime (APR), 
    these platforms are now implemented in their native API, avoiding the 
    often buggy and poorly performing POSIX-emulation layers.
<DD>A list of the MPM's currently available is <a href="mpm.html">here</a>.

<DT><STRONG>New Apache API</STRONG>
<DD>The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0. Many of the
    module-ordering problems from 1.3 should be gone. 2.0 does much of
    this automatically, and module ordering is now done per-hook to
    allow more flexibility. Also, new calls have been added that provide
    additional module capabilities without patching the core Apache server.

<dl>

<dt><strong>mod_auth_db</strong>
<dd>Now supports Berkely DB 3.0

<dt><strong>mod_auth_digest</strong>
<dd>Includes additional support for session caching across processes 
using shared memory.

<dt><strong>mod_charset_lite</strong> <dd>New module in Apache 2.0.
This experimental module allows for character set translation
or recoding.

<dt><strong>mod_dav</strong>
<dd>New module in Apache 2.0.  This module implements the 
HTTP Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) specification for
posting and maintaining web content.
