    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of New Features in Apache 2.0</h1>

    <p>Enhancements: <a href="#core">Core</a> | <a
    href="#module">Module</a></p>
    <hr />

    <h2><a id="core" name="core">Core Enhancements:</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Unix Threading</strong></dt>

      <dd>On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache can
      now run in a hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This
      should improve scalability.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New Build System</strong></dt>

      <dd>The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be
      based on autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache's
      configuration system more similar to that of other
      packages.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Multiprotocol Support</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now has some of the infrastructure in place to
      support serving multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written
      as an example.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Better support for non-Unix
      platforms</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache 2.0 is faster and more stable on non-Unix
      platforms such as BeOS, OS/2, and Windows. With the
      introduction of platform-specific <a
      href="mpm.html">multi-processing modules</a> (MPMs) and the
      Apache Portable Runtime (APR), these platforms are now
      implemented in their native API, avoiding the often buggy and
      poorly performing POSIX-emulation layers.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New Apache API</strong></dt>

      <dd>The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0.
      Many of the module-ordering problems from 1.3 should be gone.
      2.0 does much of this automatically, and module ordering is
      now done per-hook to allow more flexibility. Also, new calls
      have been added that provide additional module capabilities
      without patching the core Apache server.</dd>

      <dt><strong>IPv6 Support</strong></dt>

      <dd>On systems where IPv6 is supported by the underlying
      Apache Portable Runtime library, Apache gets IPv6 listening
      sockets by default. Additionally, the Listen,
      NameVirtualHost, and &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directives support
      IPv6 numeric address strings (e.g., "Listen
      [fe80::1]:8080").</dd>

      <dt><strong>Filtering</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache modules may now be written as filters which act on
      the stream of content as it is delivered to or from the
      server. This allows, for example, the output of CGI scripts
      to be parsed for Server Side Include directive by
      mod_include.</dd>

    <h2><a id="module" name="module">Module Enhancements:</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>mod_ssl</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0.  This module is an interface
      to the SSL/TLS strong encryption protocols provided by
      OpenSSL.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_dav</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This module implements the HTTP
      Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) specification for
      posting and maintaining web content.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_auth_db</strong></dt>

      <dd>Now supports Berkeley DB 3.0</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_auth_digest</strong></dt>

      <dd>Includes additional support for session caching across
      processes using shared memory.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_charset_lite</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This experimental module allows
      for character set translation or recoding.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_file_cache</strong></dt>

      <dd>New module in Apache 2.0. This module includes the
      functionality of mod_mmap_static in Apache 1.3, plus adds
      further caching abilities.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_headers</strong></dt>

      <dd>This module is much more flexible in Apache 2.0. It can
      now modify request headers used by mod_proxy, and it can
      conditionally set response headers.</dd>
