 <LI><A NAME="proxy">
      <STRONG>Does or will Apache act as a Proxy server?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Apache version 1.1 and above comes with a
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_proxy.html">proxy module</A>.
  If compiled in, this will make Apache act as a caching-proxy server.

 <LI><A NAME="multiviews">
      <STRONG>What are &quot;multiviews&quot;?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  &quot;Multiviews&quot; is the general name given to the Apache
  server's ability to provide language-specific document variants in
  response to a request.  This is documented quite thoroughly in the
  <A HREF="../content-negotiation.html" REL="Help">content negotiation</A>
  description page.  In addition, <CITE>Apache Week</CITE> carried an
  article on this subject entitled
  &quot;<A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/negotiation" REL="Help"
        ><CITE>Content Negotiation Explained</CITE></A>&quot;.

 <LI><A NAME="putsupport">
      <STRONG>Why can't I publish to my Apache server using PUT on
      Netscape Gold and other programs?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Because you need to install and configure a script to handle
  the uploaded files.  This script is often called a &quot;PUT&quot; handler.
  There are several available, but they may have security problems.
  Using FTP uploads may be easier and more secure, at least for now.
  For more information, see the <CITE>Apache Week</CITE> article
  <A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put"
  ><CITE>Publishing Pages with PUT</CITE></A>.

 <LI><A NAME="SSL-i">
      <STRONG>Why doesn't Apache include SSL?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  SSL (Secure Socket Layer) data transport requires encryption, and many
  governments have restrictions upon the import, export, and use of
  encryption technology.  If Apache included SSL in the base package,
  its distribution would involve all sorts of legal and bureaucratic
  issues, and it would no longer be freely available.  Also, some of
  the technology required to talk to current clients using SSL is
  patented by <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data Security</A>,
  who restricts its use without a license.
  </P>
  <P>
  Some SSL implementations of Apache are available, however; see the
  &quot;<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/related_projects.html"
        >related projects</A>&quot;
  page at the main Apache web site.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can find out more about this topic in the <CITE>Apache Week</CITE>
  article about
  <A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/ssl" REL="Help"

 <LI><A NAME="footer">
      <STRONG>How can I attach a footer to my documents
        without using SSI?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  You can make arbitrary changes to static documents by configuring an
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_actions.html#action">
  Action</A> which launches a CGI script.  The CGI is then
  responsible for setting a content-type and delivering the requested
  document (the location of which is passed in the
  <SAMP>PATH_TRANSLATED</SAMP> environment variable), along with
  whatever footer is needed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Busy sites may not want to run a CGI script on every request, and
  should consider using an Apache module to add the footer.  There are
  several third party modules available through the <A
  HREF="http://modules.apache.org/">Apache Module Registry</A> which
  will add footers to documents.  These include mod_trailer, PHP
  (<SAMP>php3_auto_append_file</SAMP>), and mod_perl
  (<SAMP>Apache::Sandwich</SAMP>).

 <LI><A NAME="search">
      <STRONG>Does Apache include a search engine?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>Apache does not include a search engine, but there are many good
  commercial and free search engines which can be used easily with
  Apache.  Some of them are listed on the <A
  HREF="http://www.searchtools.com/tools/tools.html">Web Site Search
  Tools</A> page.  Open source search engines that are often used with
  Apache include <A HREF="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</A> and <A
  HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/">SWISH-E</A>.
