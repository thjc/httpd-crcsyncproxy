<OL START=1>
 <LI><A
      NAME="what"
     ><STRONG>What is Apache?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  Apache was originally based on code and ideas found in the most
  popular HTTP server of the time.. NCSA httpd 1.3 (early 1995). It has
  since evolved into a far superior system which can rival (and probably
  surpass) almost any other UNIX based HTTP server in terms of functionality,
  efficiency and speed.
  </P>
  <P>
  Since it began, it has been completely rewritten, and includes many new
  features. Apache is, as of January 1997, the most popular WWW server on
  the Internet, according to the
  <A
   HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/Survey/"
  >Netcraft Survey</A>.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      NAME="why"
     ><STRONG>Why was Apache created?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  To address the concerns of a group of WWW providers and part-time httpd
  programmers that httpd didn't behave as they wanted it to behave.
  Apache is an entirely volunteer effort, completely funded by its 
  members, not by commercial sales.
  <HR>
  </P>
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      NAME="relate"
     ><STRONG>How does The Apache Group's work relate to other
      server efforts, such as NCSA's?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  We, of course, owe a great debt to NCSA and their programmers for
  making the server Apache was based on. We now, however, have our own
  server, and our project is mostly our own. The Apache Project is an
  entirely independent venture.

  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      NAME="name"
     ><STRONG>Why the name &quot;Apache&quot;?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  A cute name which stuck. Apache is &quot;<STRONG>A
  PA</STRONG>t<STRONG>CH</STRONG>y server&quot;.  It was
  based on some existing code and a series of &quot;patch files&quot;.

  </P>
  <P>
  Apache has been shown to be substantially faster than many other
  free servers. Although certain commercial servers have claimed to
  surpass Apache's speed (it has not been demonstrated that any of these
  &quot;benchmarks&quot; are a good way of measuring WWW server speed at any
  rate), we feel that it is better to have a mostly-fast free server
  than an extremely-fast server that costs thousands of dollars. Apache
  is run on sites that get millions of hits per day, and they have
  experienced no performance difficulties.
  </P>
  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      NAME="tested"
     ><STRONG>How thoroughly tested is Apache?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  Apache is run on over 400,000 Internet servers (as of April 1997). It has
  been tested thoroughly by both developers and users. The Apache Group
  maintains rigorous standards before releasing new versions of their
  server, and our server runs without a hitch on over one third of all
  WWW servers available on the Internet.  When bugs do show up, we
  release patches and new versions as soon as they are available.

  There is no official support for Apache. None of the developers want to

  If you are having trouble with your Apache server software, you should
  take the following steps:
  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI><STRONG>Check the errorlog!</STRONG>
    <P>
    Apache tries to be helpful when it encounters a problem.  In many
    cases, it will provide some details by writing one or messages to
    the server error log (see the
    <A
     HREF="http:../mod/core.html#errorlog"
    >ErrorLog</A>
    directive).  Somethimes this is enough for you to diagnose &amp;
    fix the problem yourself (such as file permissions or the like).

   <LI><STRONG>Check the Apache bug database</STRONG>
    <P>
    Most problems that get reported to The Apache Group are recorded in
    the bug database (available at

    ><SAMP>http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi</SAMP></A>).
    <EM><STRONG>Please</STRONG> check the existing reports, open

    that your issue has already been reported, please <EM>don't</EM> add
    a &quot;me, too&quot; report.  If the original report isn't closed
    yet, we suggest that you check it periodically.  You might also
    consider contacting the original submittor, because there may be an
    email exchange going on about the issue that isn't getting recorded
    in the database.

    ><SAMP>comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix</SAMP></A>
    newsgroup.  Many Apache users, and some of the developers, can be
    found roaming its virtual halls, so it is suggested that you seek
    wisdom there.  The chances are good that you'll get a faster answer
    there than from the bug database, even if you <EM>don't</EM> see
    your question already posted.

  NCSA httpd 1.4 and NCSA httpd 1.5.

  <P>
  NCSA httpd appears to be moving toward adding experimental features

     ><STRONG>How do I enable CGI execution in directories other than

  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
  Apache recognises all files in a directory named as a
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias"
  >ScriptAlias</A>
  as being eligible for execution rather than processing as normal
  documents.  This applies regardless of the file name, so scripts in a
  ScriptAlias directory don't need to be named
  &quot;<SAMP>*.cgi</SAMP>&quot; or &quot;<SAMP>*.pl</SAMP>&quot; or
  whatever.  In other words, <EM>all</EM> files in a ScriptAlias
  directory are scripts, as far as Apache is concerned.
  </P>
  <P>
  To persuade Apache to execute scripts in other locations, such as in
  directories where normal documents may also live, you must tell it how
  to recognise them - and also that it's okey to execute them.

     <A

    </PRE>
    The server will then recognise that all files in that location (and

  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
  It means just what it says: the server was expecting a complete set of
  HTTP headers (one or more followed by a blank line), and didn't get
  them.  The most common cause of this is Perl scripts which haven't
  disabled buffering; if you insert the following statements before your
  first <SAMP>print</SAMP> statement, this will probably go away.

  If your script isn't written in Perl, do the equivalent thing for

  <P>
  SSI (an acronym for Server-Side Include) directives allow static HTML
  documents to be enhanced at run-time (<EM>e.g.</EM>, when delivered to
  a client by Apache).  The format of SSI directives is covered
  elsewhere; suffice it to say that Apache supports not only SSI but
  xSSI (eXtended SSI) directives.
  </P>
  <P>
  Processing a document at run-time is called <EM>parsing</EM> it; hence
  the term &quot;parsed HTML&quot; sometimes used for documents that
  contain SSI instructions.  Parsing tends to be <EM>extremely</EM>
  resource-consumptive, and is not enabled by default.
  </P>
  <P>
  To enable SSI processing, you need to

   <LI>Build your server with the

   </LI>
   <LI>Make sure that the directory where you want the SSI documents to
    live is covered by the &quot;server-parsed&quot; content handler,
    either explicitly or in some ancestral location.  That can be done
    with the following:
    <PRE>
     <A
      HREF="../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler"
     >AddHandler</A> server-parsed .shtml
    </PRE>
    This indicates that all files ending in &quot;.shtml&quot; in that
    location (or its descendants) should be parsed.  Note that using
    &quot;.html&quot; will cause all normal HTML files to be parsed,
    which may put an inordinate load on your server.

  <HR>
 </LI>
 <LI><A
      NAME="ssi-part-ii"
     ><STRONG>Why don't my parsed files get cached?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  Since the server is performing run-time processing of your SSI
  directives, which may change the content shipped to the client, it
  can't know at the time it starts parsing what the final size of the
  result will be, or whether the parsed result will always be the same.
  This means that it can't generate <CODE>Content-Length</CODE> or
  <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> headers.  Caches commonly work by comparing
  the <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> of what's in the cache with that being
  delivered by the server.  Since the server isn't sending that header
  for a parsed document, whatever's doing the caching can't tell whether
  the document has changed or not - and so fetches it again to be on the
  safe side.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can work around this in some cases by causing an
  <CODE>Expires</CODE> header to be generated.  (See the
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_expires.html"
   REL="Help"
  ><CODE>mod_expires</CODE></A>
  documentation for more details.)  Another possibility is to use the
  <A
   HREF="../mod/mod_include.html#xbithack"
   REL="Help"
  ><SAMP>XBitHack Full</SAMP></A>
  mechanism, which tells Apache to send (under certain circumstances
  detailed in the XBitHack directive description) a
  <SAMP>Last-Modified</SAMP> header based upon the last modification
  time of the file being parsed.  Note that this may actually be lying
  to the client if the parsed file doesn't change but the SSI-inserted
  content does.

  So you want to include SSI directives in the output from your CGI
  script, but can't figure out how to do it?
  The short answer is &quot;you can't.&quot;  This has been regarded as a

  what the SSIs would be doing.  After all, it's generating the
  rest of the content.

  &quot;Multiviews&quot; is the general name given to the Apache

      NAME="fdlim"
     ><STRONG>Why can't I run more than &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt;
      virtual hosts?</STRONG></A>
  <P>
  The Apache server can behave unpredictably when it encounters some
  resource limitations.  One of these is the <EM>per</EM>-process limit
  on <STRONG>file descriptors</STRONG>, and that's almost always the
  cause of problems seen when adding virtual hosts.  In this
  case, it is often not actually Apache that's encountering the problem, but 
  some library routine (such as <SAMP>gethostbyname()</SAMP>)
  which needs file descriptors and doesn't complain intelligibly when it
  can't get them.
  </P>
  <P>
  Each log file requires a file descriptor, which means that if you are
  using seperate access and error logs for each virtual host each
  virtual host  needs two file descriptors.  Each 
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#listen">Listen</A> directive also needs 
  a file descriptor.  
  </P>
  <P>
  Typical values for &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt; that we've seen are in
  the neighbourhoods of 128 or 250.  When the server bumps into the file
  descriptor limit, it may dump core with a SIGSEGV, or it might just
  hang, or it may limp along and you'll see (possibly meaningful) errors
  in the error log.  One common problem that occurs when you run into
  a file descriptor limit is that CGI scripts stop being executed
  properly at times.

  As to what you can do about this:

      <STRONG>Why do I keep getting &quot;access denied&quot; for form POST

     </A>
  <P>
  The most common cause of this is a <SAMP>&lt;Limit&gt;</SAMP> section
  that only names the <SAMP>GET</SAMP> method.  Look in your
  configuration files for something that resembles the following and
  would affect the location where the POST-handling script resides:
  </P>
  <PRE>
   &lt;Limit GET&gt;
      :
  </PRE>
  <P>
  Change that to <SAMP>&lt;Limit GET POST&gt;</SAMP> and the problem
  will probably go away.

 <LI><A NAME="passwdauth">
      <STRONG>Can I use my <SAMP>/etc/passwd</SAMP> file
      for Web page authentication?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  Yes, you can - but it's a <STRONG>very bad idea</STRONG>.  Here are
  some of the reasons:
  </P>
  <UL>
   <LI>The Web technology provides no governors on how often or how
    rapidly password (authentication failure) retries can be made.  That
    means that someone can hammer away at your system's
    <SAMP>root</SAMP> password using the Web, using a dictionary or
    similar mass attack, just as fast as the wire and your server can
    handle the requests.  Most operating systems these days include
    attack detection (such as <EM>n</EM> failed passwords for the same
    account within <EM>m</EM> seconds) and evasion (breaking the
    connexion, disabling the account under attack, disabling
    <EM>all</EM> logins from that source, <EM>et cetera</EM>), but the
    Web does not.
   </LI>
   <LI>An account under attack isn't notified (unless the server is
    heavily modified); there's no &quot;You have 19483 login
    failures&quot; message when the legitimate owner logs in.
   </LI>
   <LI>Without an exhaustive and error-prone examination of the server
    logs, you can't tell whether an account has been compromised.
    Detecting that an attack has occurred, or is in progress, is fairly
    obvious, though - <EM>if</EM> you look at the logs.
   </LI>
   <LI>Web authentication passwords (at least for Basic authentication)
    generally fly across the wire, and through intermediate proxy
    systems, in what amounts to plaintext.  &quot;O'er the net we
    go/Caching all the way;/O what fun it is to surf/Giving my password
    away!&quot;
   </LI>
   <LI>Since HTTP is stateless, information about the authentication is
    transmitted <EM>each and every time</EM> a request is made to the
    server.  Essentially, the client caches it after the first
    successful access, and transmits it without asking for all
    subsequent requests to the same server.
   </LI>
   <LI>It's relatively trivial for someone on your system to put up a
    page that will steal the cached password from a client's cache.  Can
    you say &quot;password grabber&quot;?
   </LI>
  </UL>
  <P>
  If you still want to do this in light of the above disadvantages, the
  method is left as an exercise for the reader.  It'll void your Apache
  warranty, though, and you'll lose all accumulated UNIX guru points.

 <LI><A NAME="errordoc401">
      <STRONG>Why doesn't my <SAMP>ErrorDocument 401</SAMP> work?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  You need to use it with a URL in the form "/foo/bar" and not one
  with a method and hostname such as "http://host/foo/bar".  See the
  <A HREF="../mod/core.html#errordocument">ErrorDocument</A> documentation
  for details.  This was incorrectly documented in the past.

  Your
  <A
   HREF="../mod/core.html#group"
  ><SAMP>Group</SAMP></A>
  directive (probably in <SAMP>conf/httpd.conf</SAMP>) needs to name a
  group that actually exists in the <SAMP>/etc/group</SAMP> file (or
  your system's equivalent).
