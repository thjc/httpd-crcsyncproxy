      <STRONG>Why can't I run more than &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt;
      virtual hosts?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  You are probably running into resource limitations in your
  operating system.  The most common limitation is the
  <EM>per</EM>-process limit on <STRONG>file descriptors</STRONG>,
  which is almost always the cause of problems seen when adding
  virtual hosts.  Apache often does not give an intuitive error
  message because it is normally some library routine (such as
  <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE>) which needs file descriptors and
  doesn't complain intelligibly when it can't get them.
  </P>
  <P>
  Each log file requires a file descriptor, which means that if you are
  using separate access and error logs for each virtual host, each
  virtual host needs two file descriptors.  Each
  <A HREF="../mod/mpm_common.html#listen"><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>
  directive also needs a file descriptor.
  </P>
  <P>
  Typical values for &lt;<EM>n</EM>&gt; that we've seen are in
  the neighborhood of 128 or 250.  When the server bumps into the file
  descriptor limit, it may dump core with a SIGSEGV, it might just
  hang, or it may limp along and you'll see (possibly meaningful) errors
  in the error log.  One common problem that occurs when you run into
  a file descriptor limit is that CGI scripts stop being executed
  properly.
  </P>
  <P>
  As to what you can do about this:
  </P>
  <OL>
   <LI>Reduce the number of
    <A HREF="../mod/mpm_common.html#listen"><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>
    directives.  If there are no other servers running on the machine
    on the same port then you normally don't
    need any Listen directives at all.  By default Apache listens to
    all addresses on port 80.
   </LI>
   <LI>Reduce the number of log files.  You can use
    <A HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html"><SAMP>mod_log_config</SAMP></A>
    to log all requests to a single log file while including the name
    of the virtual host in the log file.  You can then write a
    script to split the logfile into separate files later if
    necessary.  Such a script is provided with the Apache 1.3 distribution
    in the <SAMP>src/support/split-logfile</SAMP> file.
   </LI>
   <LI>Increase the number of file descriptors available to the server
    (see your system's documentation on the <CODE>limit</CODE> or
    <CODE>ulimit</CODE> commands).  For some systems, information on
    how to do this is available in the
    <A HREF="perf-tuning.html">performance hints</A> page.  There is a specific
    note for <A HREF="#freebsd-setsize">FreeBSD</A> below.

    for the new value to take effect.

 <LI><A NAME="freebsd-setsize">
      <STRONG>Can I increase <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP> on FreeBSD?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  On versions of FreeBSD before 3.0, the <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP> define 
  defaults to 256.  This means that you will have trouble usefully using
  more than 256 file descriptors in Apache.  This can be increased, but
  doing so can be tricky.
  </P>
  <P>
  If you are using a version prior to 2.2, you need to recompile your
  kernel with a larger <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP>.  This can be done by adding a 
  line such as:
  </P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>options FD_SETSIZE <EM>nnn</EM></CODE>
   </DD>
  </DL>
  <P>
  to your kernel config file.  Starting at version 2.2, this is no
  longer necessary.
  </P>
  <P>
  If you are using a version of 2.1-stable from after 1997/03/10 or
  2.2 or 3.0-current from before 1997/06/28, there is a limit in
  the resolver library that prevents it from using more file descriptors
  than what <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP> is set to when libc is compiled.  To
  increase this, you have to recompile libc with a higher
  <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP>.
  </P>
  <P>
  In FreeBSD 3.0, the default <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP> has been increased to
  1024 and the above limitation in the resolver library
  has been removed.
  </P>
  <P>
  After you deal with the appropriate changes above, you can increase 
  the setting of <SAMP>FD_SETSIZE</SAMP> at Apache compilation time 
  by adding &quot;<SAMP>-DFD_SETSIZE=<EM>nnn</EM></SAMP>&quot; to the
  <SAMP>EXTRA_CFLAGS</SAMP> line in your <SAMP>Configuration</SAMP>

  <A HREF="../mod/mod_usertrack.html"><SAMP>mod_usertrack</SAMP></A>
  module, and specifically enabled it with the

  for more about <SAMP>mod_cookies</SAMP>). Apache passes on your

 <LI><A NAME="jdk1-and-http1.1">
      <STRONG>Why do my Java app[let]s give me plain text when I request
      an URL from an Apache server?</STRONG>
     </A>
  <P>
  As of version 1.2, Apache is an HTTP/1.1 (HyperText Transfer Protocol
  version 1.1) server.  This fact is reflected in the protocol version
  that's included in the response headers sent to a client when
  processing a request.  Unfortunately, low-level Web access classes
  included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.0.2 expect to see
  the version string &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot; and do not correctly interpret
  the &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; value Apache is sending (this part of the
  response is a declaration of what the server can do rather than a
  declaration of the dialect of the response).  The result
  is that the JDK methods do not correctly parse the headers, and
  include them with the document content by mistake.
  </P>
  <P>
  This is definitely a bug in the JDK 1.0.2 foundation classes from Sun,
  and it has been fixed in version 1.1.  However, the classes in
  question are part of the virtual machine environment, which means
  they're part of the Web browser (if Java-enabled) or the Java
  environment on the client system - so even if you develop
  <EM>your</EM> classes with a recent JDK, the eventual users might
  encounter the problem.
  The classes involved are replaceable by vendors implementing the
  Java virtual machine environment, and so even those that are based
  upon the 1.0.2 version may not have this problem.
  </P>
  <P>
  In the meantime, a workaround is to tell
  Apache to &quot;fake&quot; an HTTP/1.0 response to requests that come
  from the JDK methods; this can be done by including a line such as the
  following in your server configuration files:
  </P>
  <P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>BrowserMatch Java1.0 force-response-1.0
    <BR>
    BrowserMatch JDK/1.0 force-response-1.0</CODE>

  Even though the registered MIME type for MIDI files is
  <SAMP>audio/midi</SAMP>, some browsers are not set up to recognize it

      <STRONG>How do I add browsers and referrers to my logs?</STRONG>

  Apache provides a couple of different ways of doing this.  The
  recommended method is to compile the
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html"><SAMP>mod_log_config</SAMP></A>
  module into your configuration and use the
  <A HREF="../mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog"><SAMP>CustomLog</SAMP></A>
  directive.
  </P>
  <P>
  You can either log the additional information in files other than your
  normal transfer log, or you can add them to the records already being
  written.  For example:
  </P>
  <P>
  <CODE>
   CustomLog&nbsp;logs/access_log&nbsp;"%h&nbsp;%l&nbsp;%u&nbsp;%t&nbsp;\"%r\"&nbsp;%s&nbsp;%b&nbsp;\"%{Referer}i\"&nbsp;\"%{User-Agent}i\""
  </CODE>
  </P>
  <P>
  This will add the values of the <SAMP>User-agent:</SAMP> and
  <SAMP>Referer:</SAMP> headers, which indicate the client and the
  referring page, respectively, to the end of each line in the access
  log.

  When you access a directory without a trailing &quot;/&quot;, Apache needs
  to send what is called a redirect to the client to tell it to
  add the trailing slash.  If it did not do so, relative URLs would
  not work properly.  When it sends the redirect, it needs to know
  the name of the server so that it can include it in the redirect.
  There are two ways for Apache to find this out; either it can guess,
  or you can tell it.  If your DNS is configured correctly, it can
  normally guess without any problems.  If it is not, however, then
  you need to tell it.

  the directives are not necessarily those of the running server; they
  are extracted from the configuration files themselves at the time of

  If the files and the path to the files are not readable by the user as

     </A>
  <P>
  In versions of Apache prior to 1.3b2, there was a lot of confusion
  regarding address-based virtual hosts and (HTTP/1.1) name-based
  virtual hosts, and the rules concerning how the server processed
  <SAMP>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</SAMP> definitions were very complex and not
  well documented.

  Apache 1.3b2 introduced a new directive,
  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"
  ><SAMP>NameVirtualHost</SAMP></A>,
  which simplifies the rules quite a bit.  However, changing the rules
  like this means that your existing name-based
  <SAMP>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</SAMP> containers probably won't work
  correctly immediately following the upgrade.
  </P>
  <P>
  To correct this problem, add the following line to the beginning of
  your server configuration file, before defining any virtual hosts:
  </P>
  <DL>
   <DD><CODE>NameVirtualHost <EM>n.n.n.n</EM></CODE>
   </DD>
  </DL>
  <P>
  Replace the &quot;<SAMP>n.n.n.n</SAMP>&quot; with the IP address to
  which the name-based virtual host names resolve; if you have multiple
  name-based hosts on multiple addresses, repeat the directive for each
  address.
  </P>
  <P>
  Make sure that your name-based <SAMP>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</SAMP> blocks
  contain <SAMP>ServerName</SAMP> and possibly <SAMP>ServerAlias</SAMP>
  directives so Apache can be sure to tell them apart correctly.

   In the case where file system permission are at fault, remember

   but also all parent directories must be at least searchable by the
   web server in order for the content to be accessible.

       <STRONG>Why do my files appear correctly in Internet
       Explorer, but show up as source or trigger a save window
       with Netscape?</STRONG></A> 
   <P>
   Internet Explorer (IE) and Netscape handle mime type detection in different
   ways, and therefore will display the document differently.  In particular,
   IE sometimes relies on the file extension to determine the mime type.  This
   can happen when the server specifies a mime type of
   <CODE>application/octet-stream</CODE> or <CODE>text/plain</CODE>.
   (Unfortunately, this behavior makes it impossible to properly send plain
   text in some situations unless the file extension is <CODE>txt</CODE>.)
   There are more details available on IE's mime type detection behavior in an
   <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp">MSDN
   article</A>.
   </P>

   <P>
   In order to make all browsers work correctly, you should assure
   that Apache sends the correct mime type for the file.  This is
   accomplished by editing the <CODE>mime.types</CODE> file or using
   an <A HREF="../mod/mod_mime.html#addtype"><CODE>AddType</CODE></A>
   directive in the Apache configuration files.
