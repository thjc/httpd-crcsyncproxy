<h2><A name="location">The <CODE>&lt;Location&gt;</CODE> Directive</A></h2>

<STRONG>Syntax:</STRONG> &lt;Location <EM>URL prefix</EM>&gt;<BR>
<STRONG>Context:</STRONG> server config, virtual host<BR>
<STRONG>Status:</STRONG> core<BR>

<P>The &lt;Location&gt; directive provides for access control by
URL. It is comparable to the <A
HREF="mod/core.html#directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</A> directive, and
should be matched with a &lt;/Location&gt; directive. Directives that
apply to the URL given should be listen
within. <CODE>&lt;Location&gt;</CODE> sections are processed in the
order they appear in the configuration file, after the
&lt;Directory&gt; sections and <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> files are
read.</P>

<P>Note that, due to the way HTTP functions, <EM>URL prefix</EM>
should, save for proxy requests, be of the form <CODE>/path/</CODE>,
and should not include the <CODE>http://servername</CODE>. It doesn't
necessarily have to protect a directory (it can be an individual
file, or a number of files), and can include wild-cards.  In a wild-card
string, `?' matches any single character, and `*' matches any
sequences of characters.

<P>This functionality is especially useful when combined with the
<CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_mime.html#sethandler">SetHandler</A></CODE>
directive. For example, to enable status requests, but allow them only
from browsers at foo.com, you might use:

<PRE>
    &lt;Location /status&gt;
    SetHandler server-status
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    allow from .foo.com
    &lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE>
