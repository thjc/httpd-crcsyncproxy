<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Unix Threading</STRONG>
<DD>On Unix systems with POSIX threads support, Apache can now run in a
    hybrid multiprocess, multithreaded mode. This should improve
    scalability. 

<DT><STRONG>New Build System</STRONG>
<DD>The build system has been rewritten from scratch to be based on
    autoconf and libtool. This makes Apache's configuration system more
    similar to that of other packages.

<DT><STRONG>Multiprotocol Support</STRONG>
<DD>Apache now has some of the infrastructure in place to support serving
    multiple protocols. mod_echo has been written as an example.

<DT><STRONG>Better support for non-Unix platforms</STRONG>
<DD>Apache 2.0 should be faster and more stable on non-Unix platforms such
    as BeOS, OS/2, and Windows. With the introduction of platform-specific
    multiprocessing modules (MPM) and the Apache Portable Runtime, these
    platforms can now avoid using POSIX-emulation functions that are
    sometimes buggy and always hurt performance.
<DD>A list of the MPM's currently available is <a href="mpm.html">here</a>.
<DT><STRONG>New API</STRONG>
<DD>The API for modules has changed significantly for 2.0. Many of the
    module-ordering problems from 1.3 should be gone. 2.0 does much of
    this automatically, and module ordering is now done per-hook to
    allow more flexibility. Also, new calls have been added that should
    allow modules to do more without requiring patching of the core
    Apache server.
