<description>Context-sensitive smart filter configuration module</description>
<status>Extension</status>
<sourcefile>mod_filter.c</sourcefile>
<identifier>filter_module</identifier>
<compatibility>Apache 2.0 and higher</compatibility>

<summary>
<p>This module enables smart, context-sensitive configuration of
output content filters.  For example, apache can be configured to
process different content-types through different filters, even
when the content-type is not known in advance (e.g. in a proxy).
</p>
<p>mod_filter works by introducing indirection into the filter
chain.  Instead of inserting filters in the chain, we insert
a filter harness which in turn dispatches conditionally
to a filter provider.  Any content filter may be used as a provider
to mod_filter; no change to existing filter modules is required
(although it may be possible to simplify them).
</p>
</summary>

<section id="smart"><title>Smart Filtering</title>
<p>In the traditional filtering model, filters are inserted unconditionally
using <directive module="mod_mime">AddOutputFilter</directive> and family.
Each filter then needs to determine whether to run, and there is little
flexibility available for server admins to allow the chain to be
configured dynamically.</p>
<p>mod_filter by contrast gives server administrators a great deal of
flexibility in configuring the filter chain.  In fact, filters can be
inserted based on any Request Header, Response Header or Environment
Variable.  This generalises the limited flexibility offered by
<directive module="core">AddOutputFilterByType</directive>, and fixes
it to work correctly with dynamic content, regardless of the
content generator.  The ability to dispatch based on Environment
Variables offers the full flexibility of configuration with
<module>mod_rewrite</module> to anyone who needs it.</p>

<section id="terms"><title>Filter Declarations, Providers and Chains</title>
<img src="../images/mod_filter_old.gif" alt=""/>
<p>In the traditional model, output filters are a simple chain
from the content generator (handler) to the client.  This works well
provided the filter chain can be correctly configured, but presents
problems when the filters need to be configured dynamically based on
the outcome of the handler.</p>
<img src="../images/mod_filter_new.gif" alt=""/>
<p>mod_filter works by introducing indirection into the filter
chain.  Instead of inserting filters in the chain, we insert
a filter harness which in turn dispatches conditionally
to a filter provider.  Any content filter may be used as a provider
to mod_filter; no change to existing filter modules is required
(although it may be possible to simplify them).  There can be
multiple providers for one filter, but no more than one provider will
run for any single request.
</p>
<p>A filter chain comprises any number of instances of the filter
harness, each of which may have any number of providers.  A special
case is that of a single provider with unconditional dispatch: this
is equivalent to inserting the provider filter directly into the chain.
</p>
</section>
<section id="config"><title>Configuring the Chain</title>
<p>There are three stages to configuring a filter chain with mod_filter.
For details of the directives, see below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Declare Filters</dt>
<dd>The <directive>FilterDeclare</directive> directive declares a filter,
assigning it a name and a dispatch criterion.</dd>
<dt>Register Providers</dt>
<dd>The <directive>FilterProvider</directive> directive registers a provider with a filter.
The filter must have been registered with <directive>FilterDeclare</directive>.
The provider must have been registered with
<code>ap_register_output_filter</code> by some module.  The final argument
to <directive>FilterProvider</directive> is a match string, that will be checked against
the filter's dispatch criterion to determine whether to run this provider.</dd>
<dt>Configure the Chain</dt>
<dd>The above directives build components of a smart filter chain,
but do not configure it to run.  The <directive>FilterChain</directive> directive
builds a filter chain from smart filters declared, offering the
flexibility to insert filters at the beginning or end of the chain,
remove a filter, or clear the chain.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="examples"><title>Examples</title>
<dl>
<dt>Serverside Includes (SSI)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A simple case of using mod_filter in place of
<code>AddOutputFilterByType</code></p>
<example>
FilterDeclare SSI Content-Type<br/>
FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES $text/html<br/>
FilterChain SSI<br/>
</example>
</dd>
<dt>Serverside Includes (SSI)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The same as the above but dispatching on handler (classic
SSI behaviour; .shtml files get processed).</p>
<example>
FilterDeclare SSI Handler<br/>
FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES server-parsed<br/>
FilterChain SSI<br/>
</example>
</dd>
<dt>Emulating mod_gzip with mod_deflate</dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert INFLATE filter only if "gzip" is NOT in the
Accept-Encoding header.</p>
<example>
FilterDeclare gzip req=Accept-Encoding<br/>
FilterProvider gzip inflate !$gzip<br/>
FilterChain gzip<br/>
</example>
</dd>
<dt>Image Downsampling</dt>
<dd>
<p>Suppose we want to downsample all web images, and have filters
for GIF, JPEG and PNG.</p>
<example>
FilterDeclare unpack Content-Type<br/>
FilterProvider unpack jpeg_unpack $image/jpeg<br/>
FilterProvider unpack gif_unpack $image/gif<br/>
FilterProvider unpack png_unpack $image/png<br/>
FilterDeclare downsample Content-Type<br/>
FilterProvider downsample downsample_filter $image<br/>
FilterProtocol downsample "change=yes"<br/>
FilterDeclare repack Content-Type<br/>
FilterProvider repack jpeg_pack $image/jpeg<br/>
FilterProvider repack gif_pack $image/gif<br/>
FilterProvider repack png_pack $image/png<br/>
&lt;Location /image-filter&gt;<br/>
FilterChain unpack downsample repack<br/>
&lt;/Location&gt;
</example>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="protocol"><title>Protocol Handling</title>
<p>Historically, each filter is responsible for ensuring that whatever
changes it makes are correctly represented in the HTTP response headers,
and that it does not run when it would make an illegal change.  This
imposes a burden on filter authors to re-implement some common
functionality in every filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many filters will change the content, invalidating existing content
tags, checksums, hashes, and lengths.</li>
<li>Filters that require an entire, unbroken response in input need to
ensure they don't get byteranges from a backend.</li>
<li>Filters that transform output in a filter need to ensure they don't
violate a <code>Cache-Control: no-transform</code> header from the
backend.</li>
<li>Filters may make responses uncacheable.</li>
</ul>
<p>mod_filter aims to offer generic handling of these details of filter
implementation, reducing the complexity required of content filter modules.
This is work-in-progress; the <directive>FilterProtocol</directive>
implements some of this functionality, but there are no API calls yet.</p>
<p>At the same time, mod_filter should not interfere with a filter that
wants to handle all aspects of the protocol.  By default (i.e. in the
absence of any <directive>FilterProtocol</directive> directives), mod_filter
will leave the headers untouched.</p>

<var>[type]</var>
</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>

<usage>
<p>This directive declares an output filter together with a
header or environment variable that will determine runtime
configuration.  The first argument is a <code>filter-name</code>
for use in <directive>FilterProvider</directive>,
<directive>FilterChain</directive> and
<directive>FilterProtocol</directive> directives.</p>
<p>The second is a string with optional <code>req=</code>,
<code>resp=</code> or <code>env=</code> prefix causing it
to dispatch on (respectively) the request header, response
header, or environment variable named.  In the absence of a
prefix, it defaults to a response header.  A special case is the
word "handler", which causes mod_filter to dispatch on the handler.</p>
<p>The final (optional) argument
is the type of filter, and takes values of <var>ap_filter_type</var>
- namely <var>RESOURCE</var> (the default), <var>CONTENT_SET</var>,
<var>PROTOCOL</var>, <var>TRANSCODE</var>, <var>CONNECTION</var>
or <var>NETWORK</var>.

<description>Register a content filter</description>
<syntax>FilterProvider <var>filter-name</var> <var>provider-name</var> <var>match</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>

<usage>
<p>This directive registers a <em>provider</em> for the smart filter.
The provider will be called if and only if the <var>match</var> declared
here matches the value of the header or environment variable declared
as <var>dispatch</var> in the <directive>FilterDeclare</directive>
directive that declared <var>filter-name</var>.</p>
<p><var>filter-name</var> must have been declared with 
<directive>FilterDeclare</directive>.  <var>provider-name</var> must have
been registered by loading a module that registers the name with
<code>ap_register_output_filter</code>.</p>
<p>The <var>match</var> argument specifies a match that will be applied to
the filter's <var>dispatch</var> criterion.  The match may be a string
match (exact match or substring), a regexp, an integer (greater, lessthan
or equals), or unconditional.  The first characters of the <var>match</var>
argument determines this:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, if the first character is an exclamation mark
<strong>!</strong>, this reverses the rule, so the provider will be used
if and only if the match <em>fails</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, it interprets the first character excluding
any leading ! as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>default</dt>
<dd>exact match</dd>
<dt>$</dt>
<dd>substring match</dd>
<dt>/</dt>
<dd>regexp match</dd>
<dt>=</dt>
<dd>integer equality</dd>
<dt>&lt;</dt>
<dd>integer less-than</dd>
<dt>&gt;</dt>
<dd>integer greater-than</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd>Unconditional match</dd>

<usage>
<p>This configures an actual filter chain, from declared filters.
<directive>FilterChain</directive> takes any number of arguments,
each optionally preceded with a single-character control that
determines what to do:</p>
<dl>
<dt>+filter-name</dt>

<syntax>FilterProtocol filter-name [provider-name] "proto-flags"</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<usage>
<p>This directs mod_filter to deal with ensuring the filter doesn't run
when it shouldn't, and that the HTTP response headers are correctly set
taking into account the effects of the filter.</p>
<p>There are two forms of this directive.  With three arguments, it
applies specifically to a filter-name and a provider for that filter.
With two arguments it applies to a filter-name whenever the filter runs
<em>any</em> provider.</p>
<p>proto-flags is one or more of</p>
<dl>
<dt>change=yes</dt>
<dd>The filter changes the content, including possibly the content length</dd>
<dt>change=1:1</dt>
<dd>The filter changes the content, but will not change the content length</dd>
<dt>byteranges=no</dt>
<dd>The filter cannot work on byteranges and requires complete input</dd>
<dt>proxy=no</dt>
<dd>The filter should not run in a proxy context</dd>
<dt>proxy=transform</dt>
<dd>The filter transforms the response in a manner incompatible with
the HTTP <code>Cache-Control: no-transform</code> header.</dd>
<dt>cache=no</dt>
<dd>The filter renders the output uncacheable (eg by introducing randomised
content changes)</dd>

<syntax>FilterDebug filter-name level</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context></contextlist>
<usage>
<p>This directive generates debug information from mod_filter.
It is designed to help test and debug providers (filter modules), although
it may also help with mod_filter itself.</p>
<p>The debug output depends on the level set:</p>
<dl>
<dt>0 (default)</dt>
<dd>No debug information is generated.</dd>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>mod_filter will record buckets and brigades passing through the filter
to the error log, before the provider has processed them.
This is similar to the information generated by
<a href="http://apache.webthing.com/mod_diagnostics/">mod_diagnostics</a>.
</dd>
<dt>2 (not yet implemented)</dt>
<dd>Will dump the full data passing through to a tempfile before the provider.
<strong>For single-user debug only</strong>; this will not
support concurrent hits.</dd>
