  <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_file_cache</H1>
  <P>
  <STRONG>This module should be used with care.  You can easily create a
  broken site using mod_file_cache, so read this document
  carefully.</STRONG>
  </P>

  <P>
  <EM>Caching</EM> frequently requested files that change very
  infrequently is a technique for reducing server load. mod_file_cache
  provides two techniques for caching frequently requested
  <EM>static</EM> files.
  Through configuration directives, you can direct mod_file_cache
  to either open then mmap()a file, or to pre-open a file and save
  the file's open <EM>file handle</EM>. Both techniques reduce server
  load when processing requests for these files by doing part of the
  work (specifically, the file I/O) for serving the file when the server
  is started rather than during each request. 
  </P>

  <P>
  <CODE>mod_file_cache</CODE> is not compiled into the server by
  default. To use <CODE>mod_file_cache</CODE> you have to enable the
  following line in the server build <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file:
  <PRE>
    AddModule  modules/experimental/mod_file_cache.o
  </PRE>
  </P>

  <P>
  Notice: You cannot use this for speeding up CGI programs or other files
  which are served by special content handlers. It can only be used for
  regular files which are usually served by the Apache core content handler.
  </P>

  <P>
  This module is an extension of and borrows heavily from the
  mod_mmap_static module in Apache 1.3.
  </P>
  <H2>Summary</H2>
  <P>
  <CODE>mod_file_cache</CODE> caches a list of statically configured
  files via <CODE>MMapFile</CODE> or <CODE>CacheFile</CODE> directives
  in the main server configuration.
  </P>

  <P>
  Not all platforms support both directives. For
  example, Apache on Windows does not currently support the MMapStatic
  directive, while other platforms, like AIX, support both. You will
  receive an error message in the server error log if you attempt to
  use an unsupported directive. If given an unsupported directive, the
  server will start but the file will not be cached. On platforms that
  support both directives, you should experiment with both to see
  which works best for you.
  </P>

  <H3><CODE>MmapFile</CODE> Directive </H3>
  <P>
  The <CODE>MmapFile</CODE> directive of <CODE>mod_file_cache</CODE>
  maps a list of statically configured files into memory through the
  system call <CODE>mmap()</CODE>.  This system call is available on
  most modern Unix derivates, but not on all.  There are sometimes
  system-specific limits on the size and number of files that can be
  mmap()d, experimentation is probably the easiest way to find out.
  </P>
  <P>
  This mmap()ing is done once at server start or restart, only. So whenever
  one of the mapped files changes on the filesystem you <EM>have</EM> to
  restart the server (see the <A HREF="../stopping.html">Stopping and
  Restarting</A> documentation).  To reiterate that point:  if the
  files are modified <EM>in place</EM> without restarting the server
  you may end up serving requests that are completely bogus.  You
  should update files by unlinking the old copy and putting a new
  copy in place. Most tools such as <CODE>rdist</CODE> and
  <CODE>mv</CODE> do this. The reason why this modules doesn't take
  care of changes to the files is that this check would need an extra
  <CODE>stat()</CODE> every time which is a waste and against the
  intent of I/O reduction.
  </P>

  <H3><CODE>CacheFile</CODE> Directive </H3>
  <P>
  The <CODE>CacheFile</CODE> directive of <CODE>mod_file_cache</CODE>
  opens an active <EM>handle</EM> or <EM>file descriptor</EM> to the
  file (or files) listed in the configuration directive and places
  these open file handles in the cache.  When the file is requested,
  the server retrieves the handle from the cache and passes it to the
  sendfile() (or TransmitFile() on Windows), socket API. 
  </P>
  <P>
  Insert more details about sendfile API...
  </P>
  <P>
  This file handle caching is done once at server start or restart,
  only. So whenever one of the cached files changes on the filesystem
  you <EM>have</EM> to restart the server (see the <A
  HREF="../stopping.html">Stopping and Restarting</A> documentation).
  To reiterate that point:  if the files are modified <EM>in
  place</EM> without restarting the server you may end up serving
  requests that are completely bogus.  You should update files by
  unlinking the old copy and putting a new copy in place. Most tools
  such as <CODE>rdist</CODE> and <CODE>mv</CODE> do this.

  <P>
  The <CODE>MMapFile</CODE> directive maps one or more files (given as
  whitespace separated arguments) into memory at server startup time.  They
  are automatically unmapped on a server shutdown. When the files have changed
  on the filesystem at least a HUP or USR1 signal should be send to the server
  to re-mmap them.
  </P>

  <P>
  Be careful with the <EM>filename</EM> arguments: They have to literally
  match the filesystem path Apache's URL-to-filename translation handlers
  create. We cannot compare inodes or other stuff to match paths through
  symbolic links <EM>etc.</EM> because that again would cost extra <CODE>stat()</CODE>
  system calls which is not acceptable.  This module may or may not work
  with filenames rewritten by <CODE>mod_alias</CODE> or
  <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE>.

  <P>
  The <CODE>CacheFile</CODE> directive opens handles to one or more
  files (given as whitespace separated arguments) and places these
  handles into the cache at server startup time.  Handles to cached
  files are automatically closed on a server shutdown. When the files
  have changed on the filesystem, the server should be restarted to
  to re-cache them.

  <P>
  <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: don't bother asking for a for a directive which
  recursively caches all the files in a directory. Try this
  instead... 
  See the <A HREF="core.html#include">Include</A> directive, and consider this command:
  <PRE>
  find /www/htdocs -type f -print \
  | sed -e 's/.*/mmapfile &amp;/' &gt; /www/conf/mmap.conf
