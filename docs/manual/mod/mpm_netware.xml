<description>Multi-Processing Module implementing an exclusively threaded web

<summary>
    <p>This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) implements an exclusively threaded web server
    that has been optimized for Novell NetWare.</p>

    <p>The main thread is responsible for launching child
    worker threads which listen for connections and serve them when they
    arrive. Apache always tries to maintain several <em>spare</em>
    or idle worker threads, which stand ready to serve incoming
    requests. In this way, clients do not need to wait for a new
    child threads to be spawned before their requests can be
    served.</p>

    <p>The <code>StartThreads</code>, <code>MinSpareThreads</code>,
    <code>MaxSpareThreads</code>, and <code>MaxThreads</code>
    regulate how the main thread creates worker threads to serve
    requests. In general, Apache is very self-regulating, so most
    sites do not need to adjust these directives from their default
    values. Sites which need to serve more than 250 simultaneous
    requests may need to increase <code>MaxThreads</code>, while
    sites with limited memory may need to decrease
    <code>MaxThreads</code> to keep the server from thrashing (spawning and
    terminating idle threads). More information about
    tuning process creation is provided in the <a
    href="../misc/perf-tuning.html">performance hints</a>
    documentation.</p>

    <p><code>MaxRequestsPerChild</code> controls how frequently the
    server recycles processes by killing old ones and launching new
    ones.&nbsp; On the NetWare OS it is highly recommended that this directive
    remain set to 0.&nbsp; This allows worker threads to continue servicing
    requests indefinitely.</p>

    ports Apache uses</a>.</p>

<syntax>MaxThreads <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>MaxThreads 250</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
<p>The MaxThreads directive sets the desired maximum
    number worker threads allowable.</p>
</usage>
</directivesynopsis>

<directivesynopsis>
<name>MaxSpareThreads</name>
<syntax>MaxSpareThreads <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>MaxSpareThreads 100</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>MaxSpareThreads</directive> directive sets the
    desired maximum number of <em>idle</em> worker threads. An idle
    worker thread is one which is not handling a request. If there are
    more than MaxSpareThreads idle, then the main thread will kill off
    the excess worker threads.</p>

    <p>Tuning of this parameter should only be necessary on very
    busy sites. Setting this parameter to a large number is almost
    always a bad idea.</p>
</usage>

<directivesynopsis>
<name>MinSpareThreads</name>
<syntax>MinSpareThreads <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>MinSpareThreads 10</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
<p>The <directive>MinSpareThreads</directive> directive sets the
desired minimum number of <em>idle</em> worker threads. An idle worker
thread is one which is not handling a request. If there are fewer than
MinSpareThreads idle, then the main thread spawns new worker.</p>

    <p>Tuning of this parameter should only be necessary on very
    busy sites. Setting this parameter to a large number is almost
    always a bad idea.</p>

<name>StartThreads</name>
<syntax>StartThreads <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>StartThreads 50</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
<p>The StartThreads directive sets the desired
    number of worker threads to spawn and startup</p>
</usage>

<name>ThreadStackSize</name>
<syntax>ThreadStackSize <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>ThreadStackSize 65536</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive tells the server what stack size to use for
    each of the running threads. If you ever get a stack overflow
    you will need to bump this number to a higher setting.</p>
