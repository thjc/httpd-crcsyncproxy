<compatibility>Available in version 2.1 and later</compatibility>

<summary>
    <p>This module <em>requires</em> the service of <module
    >mod_proxy</module>. It provides load balancing support for
    <code>HTTP</code>, <code>FTP</code> and <code>AJP13</code> protocols
    </p>

    <p>Thus, in order to get the ability of load balancing,
    <module>mod_proxy</module> and <module>mod_proxy_balancer</module>
    have to be present in the server.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Warning</title>
      <p>Do not enable proxying until you have <a
      href="mod_proxy.html#access">secured your server</a>. Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large.</p>

<section id="scheduler">
    <title>Load balancer scheduler algorithm</title>
    <p>The idea behind this scheduler is the following:</p>

    <p><dfn>lbfactor</dfn> is <em>how much we expect this worker
    to work</em>, or <em>the workers's work quota</em>.</p>

    <p><dfn>lbstatus</dfn> is <em>how urgent this worker has to work
    to fulfill its quota of work</em>.</p>

    <p>The <dfn>worker</dfn> is a member of the load balancer,
    usually a remote host serving one of the supported protocols.</p>

    <p>We distribute each worker's work quota to the worker, and then look
    which of them needs to work most urgently (biggest lbstatus).  This
    worker is then selected for work, and its lbstatus reduced by the
    total work quota we distributed to all workers.  Thus the sum of all
    lbstatus does not change.(*)</p>

    <p>If some workers are disabled, the others will
    still be scheduled correctly.</p>
    <example><pre>
for each worker in workers
    worker lbstatus += worker lbfactor
    total factor    += worker lbfactor
    if worker lbstatus > candidate lbstatus
       candidate = worker

candidate lbstatus -= total factor

    </pre></example>
    <p>If a balancer is configured as follows:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
    worker     a    b    c    d
    lbfactor  25   25   25   25
    lbstatus   0    0    0    0
    </code></pre>

    <p>And <var>b</var> gets disabled, the following schedule is produced:</p>
    <pre><code>
    lbstatus <strong>-50</strong>    0   25   25
    lbstatus -25    0  <strong>-25</strong>   50
    lbstatus   0    0    0    <strong>0</strong>
    (repeat)
    </code></pre>
    <p>That is it schedules: a c d a c d a c d ...</p>
    <p>The following asymmetric configuration works as one would expect:</p>
    <pre><code>
    worker     a    b
    lbfactor  70   30

    lbstatus <strong>-30</strong>   30
    lbstatus  40  <strong>-40</strong>
    lbstatus  <strong>10</strong>  -10
    lbstatus <strong>-20</strong>   20
    lbstatus <strong>-50</strong>   50
    lbstatus  20  <strong>-20</strong>
    lbstatus <strong>-10</strong>   10
    lbstatus <strong>-40</strong>   40
    lbstatus  30  <strong>-30</strong>
    lbasatus   <strong>0</strong>    0
    (repeat)
    </code></pre>

    <p>That is after 10 schedules, the schedule repeats and 7 <var>a</var>
    are selected with 3 <var>b</var> interspersed.</p>

<section id="enable">
    <title>Enabling Balancer Manager Support</title>
    <p>This module <em>requires</em> the service of 
    <module>mod_status</module>.
    Balancer manager enables dynamic update of balancer
    members. You can use balancer manager to change the balance
    factor or a particular member, or put it in the off line
    mode.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, in order to get the ability of load balancer management,
    <module>mod_status</module> and <module>mod_proxy_balancer</module>
    have to be present in the server.</p>

    <p>To enable load balancer management for browsers from the foo.com
    domain add this code to your <code>httpd.conf</code>
    configuration file</p>
<example>
    &lt;Location /balancer-manager&gt;<br />
    SetHandler balancer-manager<br />
<br />
    Order Deny,Allow<br />
    Deny from all<br />
    Allow from .foo.com<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;
</example>

    <p>You can now access load balancer manager by using a Web browser
    to access the page
    <code>http://your.server.name/balancer-manager</code></p>
