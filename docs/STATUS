If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to 
apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and
http://apache-server.com/tutorials/ATdocs-project.html for an excellent
tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

- modules docs
    - mod_ssl/mod_tls: no docs
    - mod_mime: docs needed for RemoveLanguage and RemoveCharset
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0


- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0.  At least
      the httpd man page appears to be outdated, and perhaps other.
      After this is done, the manual/programs/ versions can be
      regenerated.

- XHTML conversion
        Status: unknown

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.
          - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
          - worker has no docs
          - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
        Status:  What docs still need to be touched here?
                 - invoking.html has had a first-pass cleaning done.
                 - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
                 - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
                 - misc/stopping.html
                 - dso.html
                 - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
                 - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, but needs more
      work to be complete, and needs to track changes/bug-fixes
      in the build system.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    We appear to have people working on translation into the following
    languages.  These may just be the 'it worked' page, but if so
    the authors of those should perhaps be contacted to help do the
    rest.. :-)  Note that this list is NOT identical to that for the
    1.3 documentation project..!

Things to be done in both the 1.3 and 2.0 trees
===============================================


Tutorials
=========

* Tutorial on user authentication with Apache.  Rich Bowen has contributed
  his tutorial from ApacheToday, but it needs to be cleaned up and put in
  a good format for the docs.

New User documentation
======================

* Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

* Sections (<Directory>/<Files>/<Location>)


Documentation improvements
==========================

* Improving the "security docs"

  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl
