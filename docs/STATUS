Decisions pending
=================

- Remove manual/search/manual-index.cgi from the distribution and
  httpd-2.0-docs/ repository?  These can be maintained in the httpd-site
  repository but don't belong in distributions unless we introduce the
  tools to generate the index database or keep a current database checked
  into cvs.

- Remove several out-of-place files into somewhere in the tree outside
  of the actual web site content?  Erik suggests we merge the two icons
  readmes into one.  Perhaps all of these go into httpd-2.0/docs/README?
    error/readme
    icons/readme
    icons/small/readme.txt
  Votes for a single top-level README reference?

Things That Need Fixing
=======================

- Windows platform docs are in desperate need of rewrites/updates for 2.0.
    - Bill Rowe and Bill Stoddard are good contacts for tech questions.
    - "using apache" has been done, "compiling apache" is still open
    - hints on uninstalling apache (exit monitor, close directories,
      registry entries etc) (PR 10154)
    - FAQ! UTF-8 config and URL encoding for non-ascii characters.

- New Auth system
    - Much clean-up and enhancement of aaa howto
    - Independent note on how to upgrade to new auth system

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    - mod_rewrite: explain, when what variables are actually available
      (PR 16402)
    
- MPM documentation
     - explain what the following command line options do
       (perhaps in the developer/debugging docs):
        -D DEBUG
        -D ONE_PROCESS
              one-process-mode == no threads, i.e. only one
              process handling the requests in a single loop?
        -D NO_DETACH (not in every MPM avail.)
              no daemon, but detached from terminal?
        -D FOREGROUND (not in every MPM avail.)
              ?

- Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
     - misc/custom_errordocs.html needs to be updated to
       essentially describe how the international error
       docs included in 2.0 work
     - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
     - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
     - platform/ebcdic.xml - needs major rework for 2.0

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, it is basically
      accurate, but very incomplete: many configure options are missing,
      especially those inherited from apr.

- API documentation
    - Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
    - authn provider API documentation could be useful

- Several features in Apache require write-access to the filesystem.
    Examples: CacheRoot, DavLockDB, ScriptLog
    We should treat the things consistently in the docs, and perhaps
    suggest the use of directory like /usr/local/apache2/var/ that is
    httpd-writable.

- SSL docs are generally good, but they need a refreshing by someone
  familiar with mod_ssl and openssl.

Documentation improvements
==========================

* New user docs: Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

* Enhancements to the DTD/XSL:
  - <glossary> tag that links to the glossary and uses some special 
    style in the css.
  - New index: directives by context, including listing which directives
    are available for each AllowOverride setting.
  - New index: backout modules by type (aaa, mappers, loggers etc.)
    probably by introducing a <category> element in modulesynopsis
  - Use a tag like <var> in place of <em> for things like the 
    <syntax> listing.
    - in progress
  - add letter links to glossary and quickreference, 
    perhaps also a term overview (sidebar)
  - remove <pre> elements. Use <br /> and <indent> elements to get
    a similar effect.

* Improving the documentation of the documentations' build system
  itself (requirements, procedures)

* Improving the "security docs"
  - More content and better organisation
  - mod_dav ressources are owned by the httpd

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

* Summarize all the implemented drafts/standards with short explanations
  within a document. (PR 16938)

  - I've begun working on this --jsl

* Provide example solutions for the mapping of encodings, especially
  for .gz etc. (also in regard to our default configuration)


LaTeX Todo list
==================

- Tables
  Add <columnspec> to xml files.

- Images

  A quick search makes me believe that pdftex will not handle gifs.
  It probably will handle png.

- Hundreds of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Fix build system

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable and add licenses.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Speed up the XSLT tranform.

- Translations.
