Apache HTTP Server 2.0 Documentation Status File.
Last modified: $Date: 2002/09/15 18:59:14 $

If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to docs-subscribe@httpd.apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and
http://apache-server.com/tutorials/ATdocs-project.html for an excellent
tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

- XML
    - Rewriting of the remainder of the manual into xml is in
      progress.  See the bottom of this file for status info.
    - Get mod/mod_auth_ldap.xml to validate against the current dtd.

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    
- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0. 
      Presently, these are generated from nroff man pages using
      the program in the site-tools repository, but nobody seems
      willing to update the nroff files at the moment.
      What should we do?

- MPM documentation
     - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
     - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

- Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
     - misc/custom_errordocs.html needs to be updated to
       essentially describe how the international error
       docs included in 2.0 work
     - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
     - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
     - misc/stopping.html
     - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
     - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, but many things have
      changed in the build system since it was written.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    There are several efforts underway to translate the documentation
    into other languages. A detailed list of the currently known
    translators (and the corresponding websites) can be found at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/translations.html

New User documentation
======================

* Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

Documentation improvements
==========================

* Enhancements to the DTD/XSL:
  - <glossary> tag that links to the glossary and uses some special 
    style in the css.
  - <parentdocument href="...">...</parentdocument> tag to give some
    more structure for the cookie-crumbs, etc.
  - New index: directives by context, including listing which directives
    are available for each AllowOverride setting.
  - Add more information to the directives.html index (description,
    syntax, context, ...) or perhaps add a quickreference.html
    that contains this info.
  - Use a tag like <replaceable> (but not that long) in place of
    <em> for things like the <syntax> listing.
  - Use the sitemap.xml in place of allmodules.xml to generate the
    directives.html and mod/index.html.
  - Handle more levels of sub<section>s.

* Improving the "security docs"

  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

XML Conversions

The following files need to be converted to XML as described at
