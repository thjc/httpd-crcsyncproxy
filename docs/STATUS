If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and
http://apache-server.com/tutorials/ATdocs-project.html for an excellent
tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

- XML
    - The xsl transformations could be greatly improved to a) look better
      and b) use proper CSS+html rather than the horrible hack that
      Joshua did (in progress).
    - Rewriting of the remainder of the manual into xml is in
      progress.

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    
- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0.  At least
      the httpd man page appears to be outdated, and perhaps other.
      After this is done, the manual/programs/ versions can be
      regenerated using the program in the site-tools repository.

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.
          - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
          - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
        Status:  What docs still need to be touched here?
                 - misc/custom_errordocs.html needs to be updated to
                   essentially describe how the international error
                   docs included in 2.0 work
                 - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
                 - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
                 - misc/stopping.html
                 - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
                 - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, but many things have
      changed in the build system since it was written.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    There are several efforts underway to translate the documentation
    into other languages. A detailed list of the currently known
    translators (and the corresponding websites) can be found at

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/translations.html

New User documentation
======================

* Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

* Sections (<Directory>/<Files>/<Location>)
  - I think this should be a priority.  A rewrite of /sections.html would
    be a good place to start.  That document is too technical and 
    insufficiently verbose for the average user.

* public_html - tutorial covering what is involved in helping users set
  up web serving out of their home directory.

Documentation improvements
==========================

* Improving the "security docs"

  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

* regex: We should at least document someplace what regex library we
  are using and how to find more information about it
