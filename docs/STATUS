If you are interested in helping accomplish some of the tasks on this
list or otherwise improving the documentation, please join the
apache-docs mailing list by mailing to 
apache-docs-subscribe@apache.org

For more information on how to contribute to the Apache Documentation
Project, please see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/, and
http://apache-server.com/tutorials/ATdocs-project.html for an excellent
tutorial on how to get started with making your contribution.

              ------------------------------

- XML
    - The xsl transformations could be greatly improved to a) look better
      and b) use proper CSS+html rather than the horrible hack that
      Joshua did.
    - The build system does not work very well right now.

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_proxy: updates for 2.0
    - mod_status: updates for 2.0
    - mod_example: updates for 2.0
    
- man pages
    - Some of the man pages need to be updated for 2.0.  At least
      the httpd man page appears to be outdated, and perhaps other.
      After this is done, the manual/programs/ versions can be
      regenerated.

- MPM documentation
   - Each MPM needs to have a documentation file in manual/mod/
     which lists the directives it provides, and some details
     about its operation.
        Status: Initial outlines done.  Much more details need to be
          filled in.
          - Non unix/windows MPMs still need to be completed.
          - the perchild directives in threaded/worker need docs

   - Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
        Status:  What docs still need to be touched here?
                 - misc/perf-tuning.html - needs major rewrite for 2.0
                 - misc/tutorials.html - mostly not relevant to 2.0
                 - misc/stopping.html
                 - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
                 - misc/known_client_problems.html - mostly ancient
                 - content-negotiation.html - Multiviews has changed
                   significantly since 1.3, so this needs updating
                   Bill Rowe can probably help with any questions

- New build process.
    - install.html has had a first-pass rewrite, but many things have
      changed in the build system since it was written.

- Documentation of new features.
   - This will probably require more input from new-httpd, since
     not many people here follow the development process close
     enough to know what is going on.

- API documentation
    Status: Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation

- Translations
    We appear to have people working on translation into the following
    languages.  These may just be the 'it worked' page, but if so
    the authors of those should perhaps be contacted to help do the
    rest.. :-)  Note that this list is NOT identical to that for the
    1.3 documentation project..!

New User documentation
======================

* Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)

* Sections (<Directory>/<Files>/<Location>)

* public_html - tutorial covering what is involved in helping users set
  up web serving out of their home directory.

* .htaccess - Perhaps as simple as an auto-generated listing of what
  directives are permitted in .htaccess files (possible with the
  appropriate xsl stylesheet). Would be nice if common
  examples (authentication, adding SSI or CGI capabilities, etc) could
  be given as well.


Documentation improvements
==========================

* Improving the "security docs"

  - More content and better organisation.

* General cleaning and improving of module docs

* Making the directive definitions "less terse" (i.e., adding more
  examples and details to the definitions of the directives)

  - We'll need to audit these and find out which ones need munging, as
    some of it looks ok.  --jsl

  - Every directive should have at least one example of usage, except
    those directives which list all possible usages in the Syntax
    description. And maybe some of those too. People like examples.
    mod/core.html has been checked all the way through, as have a few
    of the modules.

* Making site-specific enhancements easier, including a documented
  and robust way for 3P module docco to be added -- and have it
  survive a server docco upgrade

  - This could be something a simple and hackish as a manual/extra/
    directory (a la the 1.3 src/modules/extra/ directory) and a
    script in the support directory that scans the files there and
    updates the manual indices.  (We do something like that now for
    httpd.conf file with apxs [LoadModule, etc.].)

* regex: We should at least document someplace what regex library we
  are using and how to find more information about it
