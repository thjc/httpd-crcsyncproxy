Decisions pending
=================

Things That Need Fixing
=======================

- Windows platform docs are in desperate need of rewrites/updates for 2.x.
    - Bill Rowe and Bill Stoddard are good contacts for tech questions.
    - "using apache" has been done, "compiling apache" is still open
    - hints on uninstalling apache (exit monitor, close directories,
      registry entries etc) (PR 10154)
    - FAQ: UTF-8 config and URL encoding for non-ascii characters.

- New Auth system
    - Much clean-up and enhancement of aaa howto
    - Independent note on how to upgrade to new auth system

- modules docs
    - mod_suexec: very little documentation
    - mod_rewrite: explain, when which variables are actually available
      (PR 16402)
    
- MPM documentation
     - explain what the following command line options do
       (perhaps in the developer/debugging docs):
        -D DEBUG
        -D ONE_PROCESS
              one-process-mode == no threads, i.e. only one
              process handling the requests in a single loop?

- Individual docs will need some cleanup. 
     - misc/rewriteguide.html - needs cleaning in 1.3 and 2.0
     - platform/ebcdic.xml - needs major rework for 2.0

- API documentation
    - Ben Laurie has written some hooks documentation
    - authn provider API documentation could be useful

- SSL docs need serious update and enhancement
    - compat docs are wrong
    - no basic how to setup ssl doc
    mads said he was working on this, but...

- How does <Proxy> fit into sections.html?

Documentation improvements
==========================

* Missing documentation for the support program checkgid

* New user docs: Directory Handling (mod_dir/mod_autoindex/etc)
  (draft available in wiki)

* Enhancements to the DTD/XSL:
  - New index: directives by context, including listing which directives
    are available for each AllowOverride setting.
  - New index: backout modules by type (aaa, mappers, loggers etc.)
    probably by introducing a <category> element in modulesynopsis
  - Use a tag like <var> in place of <em> for things like the 
    <syntax> listing.
    - in progress
  - add letter links to glossary and quickreference, 
    perhaps also a term overview (sidebar)
  - remove <pre> elements. Use <br /> and <indent> elements to get
    a similar effect.

* Improving the documentation of the documentations' build system
  itself (requirements, procedures)

* Improving the "security docs"
  - More content and better organisation
  - mod_dav ressources are owned by the httpd

* Provide example solutions for the mapping of encodings, especially
  for .gz etc. (also in regard to our default configuration)

* Change the name 'Apache' to 'Apache HTTP Server' or 'http'.

LaTeX Todo list
==================

- Dozens of other little problems with presentation, cross-referencing,
  etc.

- Cleanup xsl to make it more readable.  Almost everything
  that is currently in latex.xsl should probably be moved to common.xsl.
  There may be a license problem with the atbeginend.sty file, since
  latex style files rarely have explict licenses.  At worst, we can
  drop this and manually adjust the relevant spacing.

- Reduce the size of the pdf (both bytes and pages) in any way possible.

- Translations.
