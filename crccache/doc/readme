The test setup I have been using has apache setup as two proxy servers, one on port 8080 and one on 8081.

The proxy on port 8080 is set up with mod_crccache_client as a cache provider with 8081 as an upstream proxy for it

The proxy on port 8081 is set up with mod_crccache_server and mod_deflate and fetches the pages directly.

For debugging it is useful to set max clients to 2 on the apache server so you can gdb attach to the processes if needed.

I have been using 
http_proxy=http://localhost:8080/ wget http://www.w3.org -S -t 1 -O /dev/null
to test the setup.

At the moment in the source I have hard coded the cache expiry to 30 seconds so it actually hits the upstream server
often enough for testing.

How to set-up:
See readme.ubuntu for Ubuntu
See readme.suse for Suse

See TODO for a list of things that are still pending
