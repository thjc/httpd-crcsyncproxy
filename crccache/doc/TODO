Documentation
We need to specify the crc polynomial used in the standard document.
We need to start reworking it to be suitable for circulating as an RFC, and
hopefully begin the process of making it an official standard...

Implementation
Align the implementation with the current version of this document.
Optimise how we send stream flushes and also how we cache. We should
probably implement our own caching and drop the dependency on the apache mod
cache code as we have different goals.
Allow uncompressed literal blocks in response
Change trailing block to be blocksize + extra instead of just having an 'extra' sized block
strong hash
