	# Make sure that gzip/deflate encoding

	# TODO: revise this; the proxy should provide the compressed
	#       date to the downstream client but store it non-compressed
	#       in the cache. How can this be achieved? Can it be done by
	#	invoking INFLATE filter, then crccache filter, then DEFLATE
	#       filter? I assume it will achieve the right effect but it can
	#       hardly be called efficient... And how about the etag. Will it
	#       survive intact? Can we guarantee that DEFLATE filter will use
	#       same compression parameters as the origin server used?
