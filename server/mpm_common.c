/* The purpose of this file is to store the code that MOST mpm's will need
 * this does not mean a function only goes into this file if every MPM needs
 * it.  It means that if a function is needed by more than one MPM, and
 * future maintenance would be served by making the code common, then the
 * function belongs here.
 *
 * This is going in src/main because it is not platform specific, it is
 * specific to multi-process servers, but NOT to Unix.  Which is why it
 * does not belong in src/os/unix
