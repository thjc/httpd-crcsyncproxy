For right now, the naming of the MPM methods follows
the following example for the 'prefork' method.

  1. The directory name under modules/mpm is the actual
     name.

       eg: modules/mpm/prefork

  2. The internal module name must be that name, prepended with
     mpm_ and suffixed with _module

       eg: mpm_prefork_module

  3. The Makefile.tmpl must create lib<name>.a

       eg: libprefork.a

Numbers 1 and 3 follow the normal rules (for example, modules/standard
creates libstandard.a, etc...).

The MPM_METHOD Rule will use the actual name (eg: prefork) to
pick the correct method module to build.

The following MPMs currently exist:

  prefork ....... Multi  Process Model with Preforking (Apache 1.3)
  dexter ........ Multi  Process Model with Threading via Pthreads (v2)
  mpmt_pthread .. Multi  Process Model with Threading via Pthreads (v1 = Apache/pthread)
  spmt_os2 ...... Single Process Model with Threading on OS/2
  winnt ......... Single Process Model with Threading on Windows NT
