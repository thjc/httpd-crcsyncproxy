For right now, the naming of the MPM methods follows
the following example for the 'prefork' method.

  1. The directory name under modules/mpm is the actual
     name.

       eg: modules/mpm/prefork

  2. The internal module name must be that name, prepended with
     mpm_ and suffixed with _module

       eg: mpm_prefork_module

  3. The Makefile.tmpl must create lib<name>.a

       eg: libprefork.a

Numbers 1 and 3 follow the normal rules (for example, modules/standard
creates libstandard.a, etc...).

The MPM_METHOD Rule will use the actual name (eg: prefork) to
pick the correct method module to build.

The following MPMs currently exist:

  prefork ....... Multi  Process Model with Preforking (Apache 1.3)
  perchild ...... Multi  Process Model with Threading via Pthreads
                  Constant number of processes, variable number of threads
                  each child process can have a different uid/gid.  
  threaded ...... Multi  Process Model with Threading via Pthreads
                  Variable number of processes, constant number of
                  threads/child (= Apache/pthread)
  spmt_os2 ...... Single Process Model with Threading on OS/2
  winnt ......... Single Process Model with Threading on Windows NT
