Apache 2.0alpha4 Released
------------------------

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the fourth public
alpha release of Apache 2.0.  

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase. The most visible and noteworthy addition
is the ability to run Apache in a hybrid thread/process mode on any 
platform that supports both threads and processes.  This has shown to
improve the scalability of the Apache HTTPD server significantly in our
early testing, on some versions of Unix.  This release also greatly 
improves the performance and robustness of Apache on Windows Operating 
Systems.  Lastly we are proud to announce support for BeOS in this 
version of the server.

There is more than 40 bug fixes and enhancements since alpha 3.

Apache 2.0a4 under UNIX has undergone some testing, but there are some
known issues in the current release (hey, it is an "alpha" for a
reason!). This should be considered a ``developers version'' including
only the source and no pre-compiled binaries. It is anticipated that a
binary-release will be available for the first beta release.  If you
do not feel comfortable compiling code, the Apache Group strongly
recommends that you wait for a more stable beta release before you try
this version.

Apache 2.0a4 under Windows has undergone some testing as well.  There
are known issues in the current release with regards to Apache on windows
95 and 98.  We are working through those problems, and hope to have them
fixed for future releases of the 2.0 alpha.

There is new snapshots of the Apache httpd source available every 6
hours from http://dev.apache.org/from-cvs/apache-2.0/ - please
download and test if you feel brave. We don't guarantee anything
except that it will take up disk space, but if you have the time and
skills, please give it a spin on your platforms.

Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April of 1996. The May 2000 WWW server site survey by Netcraft (see:
http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/) found that more web servers were
using Apache than any other software running on more than 60% of the
Internet web servers.

The Apache project has been organized in an attempt to answer some of
the concerns regarding active development of a public domain HTTP server
for UNIX. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the current
HTTP standards.
