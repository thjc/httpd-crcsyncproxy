Apache 2.0alpha2 Released
------------------------

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of the second public
alpha release of Apache 2.0.  

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase. The most visible and noteworthy addition
is the ability to run Apache in a hybrid thread/process mode on any 
platform that supports both threads and processes.  This has shown to
improve the salability of the Apache HTTPD server significantly in our
early testing, on some versions of Unix.  This release also greatly 
improves the performance and robustness of Apache on Windows Operating 
Systems.  Lastly we are proud to announce support for BeOS in this 
version of the server.

Apache 2.0a2 under UNIX has undergone some testing, there are
known issues in the current release, including at least one small memory 
leak.  This should be considered a ``developers version'' including only 
the source and no pre-compiled binaries. It is anticipated that a 
binary-release will be available for the first beta release.  If you do
not feel comfortable compiling code, the Apache Group strongly recommends
that you wait for a more stable beta release before you try this version. 

Apache 2.0a2 under Windows has undergone some testing as well.  There
are known issues in the current release with regards to Apache on windows
95 and 98.  We are working through those problems, and hope to have them
fixed for future releases of the 2.0 alpha.

Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April
of 1996. The February 2000 WWW server site survey by Netcraft (see:
http://www.netcraft.co.uk/Survey/) found that more web servers were
using Apache than any other software, and Apache hit an all time high of,
running on 58% of the Internet.

The Apache project has been organized in an attempt to answer some of
the concerns regarding active development of a public domain HTTP server
for UNIX. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync with the current
HTTP standards.
