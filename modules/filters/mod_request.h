 * Name/value pairs are returned in an array, with the names as
 * strings with a maximum length of HUGE_STRING_LEN, and the
 * values as bucket brigades. This allows values to be arbitrarily
 * large.
 *
 * All url-encoding is removed from both the names and the values
 * on the fly. The names are interpreted as strings, while the
 * values are interpreted as blocks of binary data, that may
 * contain the 0 character.
 *
 * In order to ensure that resource limits are not exceeded, a
 * maximum size must be provided. If the sum of the lengths of
 * the names and the values exceed this size, this function
 * will return HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE.
 *
 * An optional number of parameters can be provided, if the number
 * of parameters provided exceeds this amount, this function will
 * return HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE. If this value is negative,
 * no limit is imposed, and the number of parameters is in turn
 * constrained by the size parameter above.
 * 
 * This function honours any kept_body configuration, and the
 * original raw request body will be saved to the kept_body brigade
 * if so configured, just as ap_discard_request_body does.
 * 
 * NOTE: File upload is not yet supported, but can be without change
 * to the function call.
