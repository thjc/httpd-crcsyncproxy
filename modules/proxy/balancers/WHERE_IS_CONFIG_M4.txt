The config.m4 file that normally would be located
in this directory is actually concatted to the end
of ../config.m4 (ie: modules/proxy/config.m4).

This is done to force the correct loading of the
submodules. So if additional bundled LB submodules are
added, ../config.m4 must be updated as well.

There is likely a better way to do this...
