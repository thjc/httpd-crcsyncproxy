/*
 * The idea behind the find_best_bytraffic scheduler is the following:
 *
 * We know the amount of traffic (bytes in and out) handled by each
 * worker. We normalize that traffic by each workers' weight. So assuming
 * a setup as below:
 *
 * worker     a    b    c
 * lbfactor   1    1    3
 *
 * the scheduler will allow worker c to handle 3 times the
 * traffic of a and b. If each request/response results in the
 * same amount of traffic, then c would be accessed 3 times as
 * often as a or b. If, for example, a handled a request that
 * resulted in a large i/o bytecount, then b and c would be
 * chosen more often, to even things out.
