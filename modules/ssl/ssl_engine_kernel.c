    /* 
     * SSL renegotiations in conjunction with HTTP
     * requests using the POST method are not supported.
     *
     * Background:
     *
     * 1. When the client sends a HTTP/HTTPS request, Apache's core code
     * reads only the request line ("METHOD /path HTTP/x.y") and the
     * attached MIME headers ("Foo: bar") up to the terminating line ("CR
     * LF"). An attached request body (for instance the data of a POST
     * method) is _NOT_ read. Instead it is read by mod_cgi's content
     * handler and directly passed to the CGI script.
     *
     * 2. mod_ssl supports per-directory re-configuration of SSL parameters.
     * This is implemented by performing an SSL renegotiation of the
     * re-configured parameters after the request is read, but before the
     * response is sent. In more detail: the renegotiation happens after the
     * request line and MIME headers were read, but _before_ the attached
     * request body is read. The reason simply is that in the HTTP protocol
     * usually there is no acknowledgment step between the headers and the
     * body (there is the 100-continue feature and the chunking facility
     * only), so Apache has no API hook for this step.
     *
     * 3. the problem now occurs when the client sends a POST request for
     * URL /foo via HTTPS the server and the server has SSL parameters
     * re-configured on a per-URL basis for /foo. Then mod_ssl has to
     * perform an SSL renegotiation after the request was read and before
     * the response is sent. But the problem is the pending POST body data
     * in the receive buffer of SSL (which Apache still has not read - it's
     * pending until mod_cgi sucks it in). When mod_ssl now tries to perform
     * the renegotiation the pending data leads to an I/O error.
     *
     * Solution Idea:
     *
     * There are only two solutions: Either to simply state that POST
     * requests to URLs with SSL re-configurations are not allowed, or to
     * renegotiate really after the _complete_ request (i.e. including
     * the POST body) was read. Obviously the latter would be preferred,
     * but it cannot be done easily inside Apache, because as already
     * mentioned, there is no API step between the body reading and the body
     * processing. And even when we mod_ssl would hook directly into the
     * loop of mod_cgi, we wouldn't solve the problem for other handlers, of
     * course. So the only general solution is to suck in the pending data
     * of the request body from the OpenSSL BIO into the Apache BUFF. Then
     * the renegotiation can be done and after this step Apache can proceed
     * processing the request as before.
     *
     * Solution Implementation:
     *
     * We cannot simply suck in the data via an SSL_read-based loop because of
     * HTTP chunking. Instead we _have_ to use the Apache API for this step which
     * is aware of HTTP chunking. So the trick is to suck in the pending request
     * data via the Apache API (which uses Apache's BUFF code and in the
     * background mod_ssl's I/O glue code) and re-inject it later into the Apache
     * BUFF code again. This way the data flows twice through the Apache BUFF, of
     * course. But this way the solution doesn't depend on any Apache specifics
     * and is fully transparent to Apache modules.
     *
     * !! BUT ALL THIS IS STILL NOT RE-IMPLEMENTED FOR APACHE 2.0 !!

/*
 * Handle out temporary RSA private keys on demand
 *
 * The background of this as the TLSv1 standard explains it:
 *
 * | D.1. Temporary RSA keys
 * |
 * |    US Export restrictions limit RSA keys used for encryption to 512
 * |    bits, but do not place any limit on lengths of RSA keys used for
 * |    signing operations. Certificates often need to be larger than 512
 * |    bits, since 512-bit RSA keys are not secure enough for high-value
 * |    transactions or for applications requiring long-term security. Some
 * |    certificates are also designated signing-only, in which case they
 * |    cannot be used for key exchange.
 * |
 * |    When the public key in the certificate cannot be used for encryption,
 * |    the server signs a temporary RSA key, which is then exchanged. In
 * |    exportable applications, the temporary RSA key should be the maximum
 * |    allowable length (i.e., 512 bits). Because 512-bit RSA keys are
 * |    relatively insecure, they should be changed often. For typical
 * |    electronic commerce applications, it is suggested that keys be
 * |    changed daily or every 500 transactions, and more often if possible.
 * |    Note that while it is acceptable to use the same temporary key for
 * |    multiple transactions, it must be signed each time it is used.
 * |
 * |    RSA key generation is a time-consuming process. In many cases, a
 * |    low-priority process can be assigned the task of key generation.
 * |    Whenever a new key is completed, the existing temporary key can be
 * |    replaced with the new one.
 *
 * So we generated 512 and 1024 bit temporary keys on startup
 * which we now just handle out on demand....

     *    This CRLs signature was then already verified one round before.
