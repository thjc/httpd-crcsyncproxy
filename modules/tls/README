This currently won't work with Apache unaided. The manual things I
have to do to make it work are:

edit .../httpd-2.0/config_vars.mk:

Add "-L<where OpenSSL is> -lssl -lcrypto" to EXTRA_LIBS.

Change "modules/tls/mod_tls.la" to "modules/tls/libapachemod_tls.la" in
BUILTIN_LIBS.

edit .../httpd-2.0/modules/tls/Makefile.in:

Diddle with the openssl_state_machine.lo target to match your setup.

Then all you need is "TLSFilter on" and "TLSCertificateFile <file>" in
your config, and you are away (note that the cert file must also
contain the private key at present).
