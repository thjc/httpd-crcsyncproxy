/*
 * This module is intended to be used for testing chunked encoding.  It
 * generates a whole whack of output using ap_bputc() and ap_bputs().  It
 * also exercises start_chunk() and end_chunk() in buff.c.  To use it
 * you should use a tool like netcat and the src/test/check_chunked
 * tool.  Add something like this to your access.conf file:
 *
 * <Location /rndchunk>
 * SetHandler rndchunk
 * </Location>
 *
 * Then fake requests such as:
 *
 * GET /rndchunk?0,1000000 HTTP/1.1
 * Host: localhost
 *
 * The first arg is the random seed, the second is the number of
 * "things" to do.  You should try a few seeds.
 *
 * You should also edit main/buff.c and change DEFAULT_BUFSIZE (and
 * CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE).  Small values are particularly useful for
 * finding bugs.  Try a few different values.
 *
