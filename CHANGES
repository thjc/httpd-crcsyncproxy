Changes with Apache 2.3.0
[ When backported to 2.2.x, remove entry from this file ]

  *) mod_dav: Return "method not allowed" if the destination URI of a WebDAV
     copy / move operation is no DAV resource. PR 44734 [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) Introduced ap_expr API for expression evaluation.
     This is adapted from mod_include, which is the first module
     to use the new API.
     [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: When redirecting after successful login/logout per
     AuthzDBDRedirectQuery, do not report authorization failure, and use
     first row returned by database query instead of last row.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_rewrite: Initialize hash needed by ap_register_rewrite_mapfunc early
     enough. PR 44641 [Daniel Lescohier <daniel.lescohier cnet.com>]

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Disambiguate and tidy database authentication
     error messages.  PR 43210.  [Chris Darroch, Phil Endecott
     <spam_from_apache_bugzilla chezphil.org>]

  *) mod_cache: Handle If-Range correctly if the cached resource was stale.
     PR 44579 [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_speling: remove regression from 1.3/2.0 behavior and
     drop dependency between mod_speling and AcceptPathInfo.
     PR 43562 [Jose Kahan <jose w3.org>]

  *) mod_ldap: Correctly return all requested attribute values
     when some attributes have a null value. 
     PR 44560 [Anders Kaseorg <anders kaseorg.com>]

  *) core: check symlink ownership if both FollowSymlinks and
     SymlinksIfOwnerMatch are set [Nick Kew]

  *) core: fix origin checking in SymlinksIfOwnerMatch
     PR 36783 [Robert L Mathews <rob-apache.org.bugs tigertech.net>]

  *) rotatelogs: Added '-f' option to force rotatelogs to create the
     logfile as soon as started, and not wait until it reads the
     first entry. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_proxy: Do not try a direct connection if the connection via a
     remote proxy failed before and the request has a request body.
     [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_substitute: The default is now flattening the buckets after
     each substitution. This was mostly done to abide by the
     Principle Of Least Astonishment. The newly added 'q' flag allows for
     the quicker, more efficient bucket-splitting if the user so
     desires. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Added 'disablereuse' option for ProxyPass which, essentially,
     disables connection pooling for the backend servers.
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Activate mod_cache, mod_file_cache and mod_disc_cache as part of the
     'most' set for '--enable-modules' and '--enable-shared-mods'. Include 
     mod_mem_cache in 'all' as well. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Also install mod_so.h, mod_rewrite.h and mod_cache.h; as these
     contain public function declarations which are useful for
     third party module authors. PR 42431 [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) mod_dir, mod_negotiation: pass the output filter information
     to newly created sub requests; as these are later on used
     as true requests with an internal redirect. This allows for
     mod_cache et.al. to trap the results of the redirect. 
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) ab: Use a 64 bit unsigned int instead of a signed long to count the
     bytes transferred to avoid integer overflows. PR 44346 [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_proxy_ajp: Do not retry request in the case that we either failed to
     sent a part of the request body or if the request is not idempotent.
     PR 44334 [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) ProxyPassReverse is now balancer aware. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) rotatelogs: Don't leak memory when reopening the logfile.
     PR 40183 [Ruediger Pluem, Takashi Sato <serai lans-tv.com>]

  *) mod_ldap: Add support (taking advantage of the new APR capability)
     for ldap rebind callback while chasing referrals. This allows direct
     searches on LDAP servers (in particular MS Active Directory 2003+)
     using referrals without the use of the global catalog.
     PRs 26538, 40268, and 42557 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) ab: Do not try to read non existing response bodies of HEAD requests.
     PR 34275 [Takashi Sato <serai lans-tv.com>]

  *) Support chroot on Unix-family platforms
     PR 43596 [Dimitar Pashev <mitko banksoft-bg.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Return HTTP status codes instead of apr_status_t
     values for errors encountered while forwarding the request body
     PR 44165 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: Added server name indication support (SNI, RFC 4366).
     PR 34607. [Kaspar Brand <asfbugz velox.ch>]. A test configuration
     can be created with test/make_sni.sh [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) ApacheMonitor.exe: Introduce --kill argument for use by the
     installer.  This will permit the installation tool to remove
     all running instances before attempting to remove the .exe.
     [William Rowe]

  *) mod_proxy: Lower memory consumption for short lived connections.
     PR 44026. [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_proxy: Keep connections to the backend persistent in the HTTPS case.
     [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) rotatelogs: Improve atomicity when using -l and cleaup code.
     PR 44004 [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for OCSP validation of client certificates.
     PR 41123.  [Marc Stern <marc.stern approach.be>, Joe Orton]

  *) mod_unique_id: Fix timestamp value in UNIQUE_ID.
     PR 37064 [Kobayashi <kobayashi firstserver.co.jp>]

  *) mod_serf: New module for Reverse Proxying. [Paul Querna]

  *) core: Add the option to keep aside a request body up to a certain
     size that would otherwise be discarded, to be consumed by filters
     such as mod_include. When enabled for a directory, POST requests
     to shtml files can be passed through to embedded scripts as POST
     requests, rather being downgraded to GET requests. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix TLS upgrade (RFC 2817) support.  PR 41231.  [Joe Orton]

  *) scoreboard: Correctly declare ap_time_process_request.
     PR 43789 [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) core; scoreboard: ap_get_scoreboard_worker(sbh) now takes the sbh member
     from the connection rec, ap_get_scoreboard_worker(proc, thread) will now
     provide the unusual legacy lookup.  [William Rowe]

  *) mpm winnt: fix null pointer dereference
     PR 42572 [Davi Arnaut]

  *) core: reinstate location walk to fix config for subrequests
     PR 41960 [Jose Kahan <jose w3.org>]

  *) mod_log_config: Add format options for %p so that the actual local
     or remote port can be logged.  PR 43415.  [Adam Hasselbalch Hansen 
     <ahh@one.com>, Ruediger Pluem, Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap, mod_authn_dbd: Tidy up the code to expose authn
     parameters to the environment. Improve portability to
     EBCDIC machines by using apr_toupper(). [Martin Kraemer]

  *) mod_ldap, mod_authnzldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
     to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
     where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
     PR 42891 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for caching SSL Sessions in memcached. [Paul Querna]

  *) ab: Add -r option to continue after socket receive errors. 
     [Filip Hanik <devlist hanik.com>]

  *) mod_ldap: Fix the search limit parameter to ldap_search_ext_s()
     for SDKs that define LDAP_NO_LIMIT to something other than -1.
     [David Jones <oscaremma gmail.com>]

  *) apxs: Enhance -q flag to print all known variables and their values
     when invoked without variable name(s). 
     [William Rowe, Sander Temme]

  *) apxs: Eliminate run-time check for mod_so.  PR 40653.
     [David M. Lee <dmlee crossroads.com>]

  *) beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap_mpm_run() so that
     cleanups registered in modules' child_init hooks are performed.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_dbd: Stash DBD connections in request_config of initial request
     only, or else sub-requests and internal redirections may cause
     entire DBD pool to be stashed in a single HTTP request.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
     on Win32.  PR 40476.  [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
     the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
     AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
     location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
     weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod_dbd. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]

  *) sendfile_nonblocking() takes the _brigade_ as an argument, gets 
     the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
     bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]

  *) ap_get_server_version() has been removed.  Third-party modules must 
     now use ap_get_server_banner() or ap_get_server_description().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) All MPMs: Introduce a check_config phase between pre_config and
     open_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
     directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
     to the console.  Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
     and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
     appropriate.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_proxy: don't URLencode tilde in path component
     [Stijn Hoop <stijn sandcat.nl>]

  *) mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
     The return value is index to the signaled thread in the
     creted_threads array. We can not use WAIT_TIMEOUT because
     his value is defined as 258, thus limiting the MaxThreads
     to that value. [Mladen Turk]

  *) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod_dir
     to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
     SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]

  *) mod_proxy: Support environment variable interpolation in reverse
     proxying directives. [Nick Kew]

  *) core: Add the filename of the configuration file to the warning message
     about the useless use of AllowOverride. PR 39992.
     [Darryl Miles <darryl darrylmiles.org>]

  *) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
     configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
     The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than 
     the typical administrator is prepared to untangle.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_disk_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
     within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_cache: Convert all values to seconds before comparing them when
     checking whether to send a Warning header for a stale response.
     PR 39713. [Owen Taylor <otaylor redhat.com>]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Delete temporary files if they cannot be renamed to their
     final name. [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

  *) Worker and event MPMs: Remove improper scoreboard updates which were
     performed in the event of a fork() failure.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod_rewrite.
     [Markus Schiegl <ms schiegl.com>]

  *) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
     loading of worker_score structure with mod_status, and remove unused
     definitions relating to old life_status field.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb_score pointers
     in ap_init_scoreboard().  [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Add mod_proxy_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod_proxy.
     [Garrett Rooney, Jim Jagielski, Paul Querna]

  *) Event MPM: Fill in the scoreboard's tid field. PR 38736.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) mod_charset_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can 
     invalidate it.  Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authn_core that will provide common
     authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'.  Move the directives
     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias 
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy' 
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide 
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as 
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>' 
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR' 
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the 
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz 
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and 
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked 
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to 
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
     [Martin Kraemer, David Reid]
