     [Paul Querna]

  *) core: When the ap_http_header_filter processes an error bucket, cleanup
     the passed brigade before returning AP_FILTER_ERROR down the filter 
     chain. This unambiguously ensures the same error bucket isn't revisited

     the buffer, not to the final brigade. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_buffer: Optimise the buffering of heap buckets when the heap
     buckets stay exactly APR_BUCKET_BUFF_SIZE long. [Graham Leggett,
     Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_buffer: Optional support for buffering of the input and output
     filter stacks. Can collapse many small buckets into fewer larger
     buckets, and prevents excessively small chunks being sent over
     the wire. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_privileges: new module to make httpd on Solaris privileges-aware
     and to enable different virtualhosts to run with different
     privileges and Unix user/group IDs [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_dir: Support "DirectoryIndex disabled" 
     Suggested By André Warnier <aw ice-sa.com> [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: Send Content-Type application/ocsp-request for POST requests to
     OSCP responders. PR 46014 [Dr Stephen Henson <steve openssl.org>]

     rewrite_mapfunc_t and ap_register_rewrite_mapfunc functions are
     available to third party modules. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: don't return NULL-valued environment variables to
     other modules.  PR 39045 [Francois Pesce <francois.pesce gmail.com>]

     faked directly after login. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_cookie, mod_session_dbd: Make sure cookies are set both
     within the output headers and error output headers, so that the
     session is maintained across redirects. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_auth_form: Make sure the logged in user is populated correctly
     after a form login. Fixes a missing REMOTE_USER variable directly
     following a login. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_cookie: Make sure that cookie attributes are correctly
     included in the blank cookie when cookies are removed. This fixes an
     inability to log out when using mod_auth_form. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_autoindex: add configuration option to insert string
     in HTML HEAD. [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_session: Prevent a segfault when a CGI script sets a cookie with a
     null value. [David Shane Holden <dpejesh apache.org>]

     [Tom Donovan]

  *) core, authn/z: Determine registered authn/z providers directly in
     ap_setup_auth_internal(), which allows optional functions that just
     wrapped ap_list_provider_names() to be removed from authn/z modules.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) authn/z: Convert common provider version strings to macros.
     [Chris Darroch]

     ap_location_walk(), don't look past the start of an empty string
     such as that created by a <Location ""> directive.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) core, mod_proxy: If a kept_body is present, it becomes safe for
     subrequests to support message bodies. Make sure that safety
     checks within the core and within the proxy are not triggered
     when kept_body is present. This makes it possible to embed
     proxied POST requests within mod_include. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_auth_form: Make sure the input filter stack is properly set
     up before reading the login form. Make sure the kept body filter
     is correctly inserted to ensure the body can be read a second
     time safely should the authn be successful. [Graham Leggett,
     Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_request: Insert the KEPT_BODY filter via the insert_filter
     hook instead of during fixups. Add a safety check to ensure the
     filters cannot be inserted more than once. [Graham Leggett,
     Ruediger Pluem]

  *) core: Do not allow Options ALL if not all options are allowed to be
     overwritten. PR 44262 [Michał Grzędzicki <lazy iq.pl>]

  *) ap_cache_cacheable_headers_out() will (now) always
     merge an error headers _before_ clearing them and _before_
     merging in the actual entity headers and doing normal
     hop-by-hop cleansing. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) cache: retire ap_cache_cacheable_hdrs_out() which was used
     for both in- and out-put headers; and replace it by a single
     ap_cache_cacheable_headers() wrapped in a in- and out-put
     specific ap_cache_cacheable_headers_in()/out(). The latter
     which will also merge error and ensure content-type. To keep
     cache modules consistent with ease. This API change bumps
     up the minor MM by one [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) mod_rewrite: Allow Cookie option to set secure and HttpOnly flags.
     PR 44799 [Christian Wenz <christian wenz.org>]

  *) Move the KeptBodySize directive, kept_body filters and the
     ap_parse_request_body function out of the http module and into a
     new module called mod_request, reducing the size of the core.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Handle integer configuration directive parameters with a
     dedicated function.

  *) Change the directives within the mod_session* modules to be valid
     both inside and outside the location/directory sections, as
     suggested by wrowe. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_auth_form: Add a module capable of allowing end users to log
     in using an HTML form, storing the credentials within mod_session.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add a function to the http filters that is able to parse an HTML
     form request with the type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_crypto: Initialise SSL in the post config hook.
     [Ruediger Pluem, Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_dbd: Add a session implementation capable of storing
     session information in a SQL database via the dbd interface. Useful
     for sites where session privacy is important. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_crypto: Add a session encoding implementation capable
     of encrypting and decrypting sessions wherever they may be stored.
     Introduces a level of privacy when sessions are stored on the
     browser. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session_cookie: Add a session implementation capable of storing
     session information within cookies on the browser. Useful for high
     volume sites where server bound sessions are too resource intensive.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_session: Add a generic session interface to unify the different
     attempts at saving persistent sessions across requests.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
     with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
     original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
     with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
     providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
     Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
     which can accept additional mode and flag data.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Introduced ap_expr API for expression evaluation.
     This is adapted from mod_include, which is the first module
     to use the new API.
     [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: When redirecting after successful login/logout per
     AuthzDBDRedirectQuery, do not report authorization failure, and use
     first row returned by database query instead of last row.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_ldap: Correctly return all requested attribute values
     when some attributes have a null value. 
     PR 44560 [Anders Kaseorg <anders kaseorg.com>]

  *) core: check symlink ownership if both FollowSymlinks and
     SymlinksIfOwnerMatch are set [Nick Kew]

  *) core: fix origin checking in SymlinksIfOwnerMatch
     PR 36783 [Robert L Mathews <rob-apache.org.bugs tigertech.net>]

  *) Activate mod_cache, mod_file_cache and mod_disc_cache as part of the
     'most' set for '--enable-modules' and '--enable-shared-mods'. Include 
     mod_mem_cache in 'all' as well. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Also install mod_so.h, mod_rewrite.h and mod_cache.h; as these
     contain public function declarations which are useful for
     third party module authors. PR 42431 [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) mod_dir, mod_negotiation: pass the output filter information
     to newly created sub requests; as these are later on used
     as true requests with an internal redirect. This allows for
     mod_cache et.al. to trap the results of the redirect. 
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_ldap: Add support (taking advantage of the new APR capability)
     for ldap rebind callback while chasing referrals. This allows direct
     searches on LDAP servers (in particular MS Active Directory 2003+)
     using referrals without the use of the global catalog.
     PRs 26538, 40268, and 42557 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_ssl: Added server name indication support (SNI, RFC 4366).
     PR 34607. [Kaspar Brand <asfbugz velox.ch>]. A test configuration
     can be created with test/make_sni.sh [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].

  *) ApacheMonitor.exe: Introduce --kill argument for use by the
     installer.  This will permit the installation tool to remove
     all running instances before attempting to remove the .exe.
     [William Rowe]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for OCSP validation of client certificates.
     PR 41123.  [Marc Stern <marc.stern approach.be>, Joe Orton]

  *) mod_serf: New module for Reverse Proxying. [Paul Querna]

  *) core: Add the option to keep aside a request body up to a certain
     size that would otherwise be discarded, to be consumed by filters
     such as mod_include. When enabled for a directory, POST requests
     to shtml files can be passed through to embedded scripts as POST
     requests, rather being downgraded to GET requests. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix TLS upgrade (RFC 2817) support.  PR 41231.  [Joe Orton]

  *) scoreboard: Correctly declare ap_time_process_request.
     PR 43789 [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) core; scoreboard: ap_get_scoreboard_worker(sbh) now takes the sbh member
     from the connection rec, ap_get_scoreboard_worker(proc, thread) will now
     provide the unusual legacy lookup.  [William Rowe]

  *) mpm winnt: fix null pointer dereference
     PR 42572 [Davi Arnaut]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap, mod_authn_dbd: Tidy up the code to expose authn
     parameters to the environment. Improve portability to
     EBCDIC machines by using apr_toupper(). [Martin Kraemer]

  *) mod_ldap, mod_authnzldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
     to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
     where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
     PR 42891 [Paul J. Reder]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for caching SSL Sessions in memcached. [Paul Querna]

  *) mod_ldap: Fix the search limit parameter to ldap_search_ext_s()
     for SDKs that define LDAP_NO_LIMIT to something other than -1.
     [David Jones <oscaremma gmail.com>]

  *) apxs: Enhance -q flag to print all known variables and their values
     when invoked without variable name(s). 
     [William Rowe, Sander Temme]

  *) apxs: Eliminate run-time check for mod_so.  PR 40653.
     [David M. Lee <dmlee crossroads.com>]

  *) beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap_mpm_run() so that
     cleanups registered in modules' child_init hooks are performed.
     [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_dbd: Stash DBD connections in request_config of initial request
     only, or else sub-requests and internal redirections may cause
     entire DBD pool to be stashed in a single HTTP request.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
     on Win32.  PR 40476.  [Tom Donovan <Tom.Donovan acm.org>]

  *) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
     the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
     AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
     location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_authn_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
     into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE_<COLUMN>. This brings
     mod_authn_dbd behaviour in line with mod_authnz_ldap. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
     value of server_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
     may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
     weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod_dbd. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]

  *) sendfile_nonblocking() takes the _brigade_ as an argument, gets 
     the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
     bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]

  *) ap_get_server_version() has been removed.  Third-party modules must 
     now use ap_get_server_banner() or ap_get_server_description().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) All MPMs: Introduce a check_config phase between pre_config and
     open_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
     directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
     to the console.  Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
     and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
     appropriate.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) mod_proxy: don't URLencode tilde in path component
     [Stijn Hoop <stijn sandcat.nl>]

  *) mpm_winnt: Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
     The return value is index to the signaled thread in the
     creted_threads array. We can not use WAIT_TIMEOUT because
     his value is defined as 258, thus limiting the MaxThreads
     to that value. [Mladen Turk]

  *) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod_dir
     to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
     SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]

  *) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
     configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
     The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than 
     the typical administrator is prepared to untangle.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_disk_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
     within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
     [Niklas Edmundsson <nikke acc.umu.se>]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Delete temporary files if they cannot be renamed to their
     final name. [Davi Arnaut <davi haxent.com.br>]

     performed in the event of a fork() failure.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod_rewrite.
     [Markus Schiegl <ms schiegl.com>]

  *) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
     loading of worker_score structure with mod_status, and remove unused
     definitions relating to old life_status field.
     [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb_score pointers
     in ap_init_scoreboard().  [Chris Darroch <chrisd pearsoncmg.com>]

  *) Add mod_proxy_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod_proxy.

  *) mod_charset_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can 
     invalidate it.  Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authn_core that will provide common
     authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'.  Move the directives
     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias 
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy' 
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide 
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as 
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>' 
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR' 
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the 
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz 
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and 
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked 
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to 
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
     [Martin Kraemer, David Reid]
