/*
    The MPM, "multi-processing model" provides an abstraction of the
    interface with the OS for distributing incoming connections to
    threads/process for processing.  http_main invokes the MPM, and
    the MPM runs until a shutdown/restart has been indicated.
    The MPM calls out to the apache core via the ap_process_connection
    function when a connection arrives.

    The MPM may or may not be multithreaded.  In the event that it is
    multithreaded, at any instant it guarantees a 1:1 mapping of threads
    ap_process_connection invocations.  

    Note: In the future it will be possible for ap_process_connection
    to return to the MPM prior to finishing the entire connection; and
    the MPM will proceed with asynchronous handling for the connection;
    in the future the MPM may call ap_process_connection again -- but
    does not guarantee it will occur on the same thread as the first call.

    The MPM further guarantees that no asynchronous behaviour such as
    longjmps and signals will interfere with the user code that is
    invoked through ap_process_connection.  The MPM may reserve some
    signals for its use (i.e. SIGUSR1), but guarantees that these signals
    are ignored when executing outside the MPM code itself.  (This
    allows broken user code that does not handle EINTR to function
    properly.)

    The suggested server restart and stop behaviour will be "graceful".
    However the MPM may choose to terminate processes when the user
    requests a non-graceful restart/stop.  When this occurs, the MPM kills
    all threads with extreme prejudice, and destroys the pchild pool.
    User cleanups registered in the pchild ap_context_t will be invoked at
    this point.  (This can pose some complications, the user cleanups
    are asynchronous behaviour not unlike longjmp/signal... but if the
    admin is asking for a non-graceful shutdown, how much effort should
    we put into doing it in a nice way?)

    unix/posix notes:
    - The MPM does not set a SIGALRM handler, user code may use SIGALRM.
	But the preferred method of handling timeouts is to use the
	timeouts provided by the BUFF/iol abstraction.
    - The proper setting for SIGPIPE is SIG_IGN, if user code changes it
        for any of their own processing, it must be restored to SIG_IGN
	prior to executing or returning to any apache code.
    TODO: add SIGPIPE debugging check somewhere to make sure its SIG_IGN
