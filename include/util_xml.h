** XML PARSING
*/

/*
** Qualified namespace values
**
** AP_XML_NS_DAV_ID
**    We always insert the "DAV:" namespace URI at the head of the
**    namespace array. This means that it will always be at ID==0,
**    making it much easier to test for.
**
** AP_XML_NS_NONE
**    This special ID is used for two situations:
**
**    1) The namespace prefix begins with "xml" (and we do not know
**       what it means). Namespace prefixes with "xml" (any case) as
**       their first three characters are reserved by the XML Namespaces
**       specification for future use. mod_dav will pass these through
**       unchanged. When this identifier is used, the prefix is LEFT in
**       the element/attribute name. Downstream processing should not
**       prepend another prefix.
**
**    2) The element/attribute does not have a namespace.
**
**       a) No prefix was used, and a default namespace has not been
**          defined.
**       b) No prefix was used, and the default namespace was specified
**          to mean "no namespace". This is done with a namespace
**          declaration of:  xmlns=""
**          (this declaration is typically used to override a previous
**          specification for the default namespace)
**
**       In these cases, we need to record that the elem/attr has no
**       namespace so that we will not attempt to prepend a prefix.
**       All namespaces that are used will have a prefix assigned to
**       them -- mod_dav will never set or use the default namespace
**       when generating XML. This means that "no prefix" will always
**       mean "no namespace".
**
**    In both cases, the XML generation will avoid prepending a prefix.
**    For the first case, this means the original prefix/name will be
**    inserted into the output stream. For the latter case, it means
**    the name will have no prefix, and since we never define a default
**    namespace, this means it will have no namespace.
**
** Note: currently, mod_dav understands the "xmlns" prefix and the
**     "xml:lang" attribute. These are handled specially (they aren't
**     left within the XML tree), so the AP_XML_NS_NONE value won't ever
**     really apply to these values.
