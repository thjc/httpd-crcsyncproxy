/*
 * FILTER CHAIN
 *
 * Filters operate using a "chaining" mechanism. The filters are chained
 * together into a sequence. When output is generated, it is passed through
 * each of the filters on this chain, until it reaches the end (or "bottom")
 * and is placed onto the network.
 *
 * The top of the chain, the code generating the output, is typically called
 * a "content generator." The content generator's output is fed into the
 * filter chain using the standard Apache output mechanisms: ap_rputs(),
 * ap_rprintf(), ap_rwrite(), etc.
 *
 * Each filter is defined by a callback. This callback takes the output from
 * the previous filter (or the content generator if there is no previous
 * filter), operates on it, and passes the result to the next filter in the
 * chain. This pass-off is performed using the ap_fc_* functions, such as
 * ap_fc_puts(), ap_fc_printf(), ap_fc_write(), etc.
 *
 * When content generation is complete, the system will pass an "end of
 * stream" marker into the filter chain. The filters will use this to flush
 * out any internal state and to detect incomplete syntax (for example, an
 * unterminated SSI directive).
 */

typedef struct ap_filter_t ap_filter_t;

/*
 * ap_filter_func:
 *
 * This function type is used for filter callbacks. It will be passed a
 * pointer to "this" filter, and a "bucket" containing the content to be
 * filtered.
 *
 * In filter->ctx, the callback will find its context. This context is
 * provided here, so that a filter may be installed multiple times, each
 * receiving its own per-install context pointer.
 *
 * Callbacks are associated with a filter definition, which is specified
 * by name. See ap_register_filter() for setting the association between
 * a name for a filter and its associated callback (and other information).
 *
 * The *bucket structure (and all those referenced by ->next and ->prev)
 * should be considered "const". The filter is allowed to modify the
 * next/prev to insert/remove/replace elements in the bucket list, but
 * the types and values of the individual buckets should not be altered.

 * Filters have different types/classifications. These are used to group

 *
 * AP_FTYPE_CONTENT:
 *     These filters are used to alter the content that is passed through
 *     them. Examples are SSI or PHP.
 *
 * AP_FTYPE_CONNECTION:
 *     These filters will alter the content, but in ways that are more
 *     strongly associated with the output connection. Examples are
 *     compression, character recoding, or chunked transfer coding.
 *
 *     It is important to note that these types of filters are not allowed
 *     in a sub-request. A sub-requests output can certainly be filtered
 *     by AP_FTYPE_CONTENT filters, but all of the "final processing" is
 *     determined by the main request.
 *
 * The types have a particular sort order, which allows us to insert them
 * into the filter chain in a determistic order. Within a particular grouping,
 * the ordering is equivalent to the order of calls to ap_add_filter().

 * installed filter, and the filter ordering/chaining fields.
 *
 * Filter callbacks are free to use ->ctx as they please, to store context
 * during the filter process. Generally, this is superior over associating
 * the state directly with the request. A callback should not change any of

 *      comment breaks that, well sorry, but the information must be there
 *      somewhere.  :-)

 * Add a function like ap_pass_data.  This function will basically just
 * call the next filter in the chain, until the current filter is NULL.  If the
 * current filter is NULL, that means that nobody wrote to the network, and
 * we have a HUGE bug, so we need to return an error and log it to the
