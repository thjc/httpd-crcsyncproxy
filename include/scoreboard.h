/* A "virtual time" is simply a counter that indicates that a child is

 * made progress it resets the last_rtime element.  But when the child hasn't
 * made progress in a time that's roughly timeout_len seconds long, it is
 * sent a SIGALRM.
 *
 * vtime is an optimization that is used only when the scoreboard is in
 * shared memory (it's not easy/feasible to do it in a scoreboard file).
 * The essential observation is that timeouts rarely occur, the vast majority
 * of hits finish before any timeout happens.  So it really sucks to have to
 * ask the operating system to set up and destroy alarms many times during
 * a request.

 * example, the vhostrec pointer in the scoreboard below is valid in all
 * children of the same generation.
 *
 * The safe way to access the vhost pointer is like this:
 *
 * short_score *ss = pointer to whichver slot is interesting;
 * parent_score *ps = pointer to whichver slot is interesting;
 * server_rec *vh = ss->vhostrec;
 *
 * if (ps->generation != ap_my_generation) {

 * then if vh is not NULL it's valid in this child.
