SNI Files generated
===================

The directory ${DIR}/sni has been populated with the following

-       root.key|pem    Certificate authority root and key. (You could
                        import the root.pem key into your browser to
                        quell warnings about an unknown authority).

-       hosts           /etc/hosts file with fake entries for the hosts

-       htdocs          directory with one docroot for each domain,
                        each with a small sample file.

-       ssl             directory with an ssl cert (signed by root)
                        for each of the domains).

-       logs            logfiles, one for each domain and an
                        access_log for any misses.

SNI Test
========

A directory ${DIR}/sni has been created. Run an apache
server against it with

    .../httpd -f ${DIR}/httpd-sni.conf

and keep an eye on ${DIR}/logs/error_log. When everything 
is fine you will see entries like:

    Feb 11 16:12:26 2008] [debug] Init: 
        SSL server IP/port overlap: ape.*:443 (httpd-sni.conf:24) vs. jane.*:443 (httpd-sni.conf:42)

for each vhost configured and a concluding warning:

    [Mon Feb 11 16:12:26 2008] [warn] Init: 
        Name-based SSL virtual hosts only work for clients with TLS server name indication support (RFC 4366)

HOWEVER - If you see an entry like:

    [Mon Feb 11 15:41:41 2008] [warn] Init: 
        You should not use name-based virtual hosts in conjunction with SSL!!

then you are either using an OpenSSL which is too old and/or you need to ensure that the
TLS Extensions are compiled into openssl with the 'enable-tlsext' flag. Once you have
recompiled or reinstalled OpenSSL with TLS Extensions you will have to recompile mod_ssl
to allow it to recognize SNI support.

Meanwhile add 'hosts' to your c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
or /etc/hosts file as to point the various URL's to your server:
$LST

and verify that each returns its own name (and an entry in its
own ${DIR}/logs) file).
